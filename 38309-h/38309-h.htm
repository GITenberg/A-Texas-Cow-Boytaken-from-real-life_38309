<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>My excuse for writing this book is money&mdash;and
lots of it.</p>

<p>I suppose the above would suffice, but as time is
not very precious I will continue and tell how the
idea of writing a book first got into my head:</p>

<p>While ranching on the Indian Territory line,
close to Caldwell, Kansas, in the winter of '82 and
'83, we boys&mdash;there being nine of us&mdash;made an iron-clad
rule that whoever was heard swearing or caught
picking grey backs off and throwing them on the
floor without first killing them, should pay a fine of
ten cents for each and every offense. The proceeds
to be used for buying choice literature&mdash;something
that would have a tendency to raise us above the
average cow-puncher. Just twenty-four hours after
making this rule we had three dollars in the pot&mdash;or
at least in my pocket, I having been appointed
treasurer.</p>

<p>As I was going to town that night to see my
Sunday girl, I proposed to the boys that, while up
there, I send the money off for a years subscription
to some good newspaper. The question then came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
up, what paper shall it be? We finally agreed to
leave it to a vote&mdash;each man to write the one of his
choice on a slip of paper and drop it in a hat.
There being two young Texans present who could
neither read nor write, we let them <i>speak</i> their
choice after the rest of us got our votes deposited.
At the word given them to cut loose they both yelled
"Police Gazette", and on asking why they voted for
that wicked Sheet, they both replied as though with
one voice: "Cause we can read the pictures." We
found, on counting the votes that the Police Gazette
had won, so it was subscribed for.</p>

<p>With the first copy that arrived was the beginning
of a continued story, entitled "Potts turning Paris
inside out." Mr. Potts, the hero, was an old stove-up
New York preacher, who had made a raise of
several hundred thousand dollars and was over in
Paris blowing it in. I became interested in the
story, and envied Mr. Potts very much. I wished
for a few hundred thousand so I could do likewise;
I lay awake one whole night trying to study up a
plan by which I could make the desired amount.
But, thinks I, what can an uneducated cow puncher
do now-a-days to make such a vast sum? In trying
to solve the question my mind darted back a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
years, when, if I had taken time by the forelock, I
might have now been wallowing in wealth with the
rest of the big cattle kings&mdash;or to use a more appropriate
name, cattle thieves. But alas! thought I, the
days of honorable cattle stealing is past, and I must
turn my mind into a healthier channel.</p>

<p>The next morning while awaiting breakfast I
happened to pick up a small scrap of paper and
read: "To the young man of high aims literature
offers big inducements, providing he gets into an
untrodden field."</p>

<p>That night I lay awake again, trying to locate
some "cussed" untrodden field, where, as an author,
I might soar on high&mdash;to the extent of a few hundred
thousand at least.</p>

<p>At last, just as our pet rooster, "Deacon Bates"
was crowing for day, I found a field that I had never
heard of any one trampling over&mdash;a "nigger" love
story. So that night I launched out on my new
novel, the title of which was, "A pair of two-legged
coons." My heroine, Miss Patsy Washington was
one shade darker than the ace of spades, while her
lover, Mr. Andrew Jackson, was three colors darker
than herself. My plot was laid in African Bend on
the Colorado river in Southern Texas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything went on nicely, until about half way
through the first chapter, when Mr. Jackson was
convicted and sent to Huntsville for stealing a
neighbors hog; and while I was trying to find a
substitute for him, old Patsy flew the track and
eloped with a Yankee carpet-bagger. That was
more than I could endure, so picking up the manuscript
I threw it into the fire. Thus ended my first
attempt at Authorship.</p>

<p>I then began figuring up an easier field for my
inexperienced pen, and finally hit upon the idea of
writing a history of my own short, but rugged life,
which dear reader you have before you. But
whether it will bring me in "shekels" enough to
capsize Paris remains yet to be "disskivered" as
the Negro says.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">MY BOYHOOD DAYS.</p>

<p>It was a bright morning, on the 7th day of February
1856, as near as I can remember, that your
humble Servant came prancing into this wide and
wicked world.</p>

<p>By glancing over the map you will find his birthplace,
at the extreme southern part of the Lone
Star State, on the Peninsula of Matagorda, a narrow
strip of land bordered by the Gulf of Mexico on the
south and Matagorda Bay on the north.</p>

<p>This Peninsula is from one to two miles wide and
seventy five miles long. It connects the mainland
at Caney and comes to a focus at Deskrows Point
or "Salura Pass." About midway between the two
was situated the "Dutch Settlement," and in the
centre of that Settlement, which contained only a
dozen houses, stood the little frame cottage that first
gave me shelter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>My father who died when I was only a year old,
came from the sunny clime of Italy, while my dear
old mother drifted from the Boggs of good "ould"
Ireland. Am I not a queer conglomerate&mdash;a sweet-scented
mixture indeed!</p>

<p>Our nearest neighbor was a kind old soul by the
name of John Williams, whose family consisted of
his wife and eleven children.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1859 I took my first lessons in
school, my teacher being a Mr. Hale from Illinois.</p>

<p>The school house, a little old frame building,
stood off by itself, about a mile from the Settlement,
and we little tow-heads, sister and I, had
to hoof it up there every morning, through the
grassburrs, barefooted; our little sunbrowned feet
had never been incased in shoe-leather up to that
time.</p>

<p>To avoid the grassburrs, sometimes on getting
an early start we would go around by the Gulf
beach which was quite a distance out of our way.
In taking this route though, I would generally be
late at school, for there were so many little things
to detain me&mdash;such as trying to catch the shadow
of a flying sea gull, or trying to lasso sand crabs
on my stick horse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Crowds of Cow Boys used to come over to the
Peninsula from the mainland and sometimes have
occasion to rope wild steers in my presence&mdash;hence
me trying to imitate them.</p>

<p>I remember getting into a scrape once by taking
the beach route to school; sister who was a year
older than I, was walking along the water edge
picking up pretty shells while I was riding along on
my stick horse taking the kinks out of my rope&mdash;a
piece of fishline&mdash;so as to be ready to take in the
first crab that showed himself. Those crabs went in
large droves and sometimes ventured quite a distance
out from the Gulf, but on seeing a person
would break for the water.</p>

<p>It was not long before I spied a large drove on
ahead, pulling their freight for the water. I put
spurs to my pony and dashed after them. I managed
to get one old fat fellow headed off and turned
towards the prairie. I threw at him several times
but he would always go through the loop before I
could pull it up. He finally struck a hole and disappeared.</p>

<p>I was determined to get him out and take another
whirl at him, so dropping my horse and getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
down on all fours I began digging the sand
away with my hands, dog fashion.</p>

<p>About that time sister came up and told me to
come on as I would be late at school, etc.</p>

<p>I think I told her to please go to Halifax, as I was
going to rope that crab before I quit or "bust." At
any rate she went off, leaving me digging with all
my might.</p>

<p>Every now and then I would play dog by sticking
my snoot down in the hole to smell. But I rammed
it down once too often. Mr. Crab was nearer the
surface than I thought for. He was laying for me.
I gave a comanche yell, jumped ten feet in the air
and lit out for home at a 2:40 gait. One of his
claws was fastened to my upper lip while the other
clamped my nose with an iron-like grip.</p>

<p>I met Mr. William Berge coming out to the beach
after a load of wood, and he relieved me of my uncomfortable
burden. He had to break the crabs
claws off to get him loose.</p>

<p>I arrived at school just as Mr. Hale was ringing
the bell after recess. He called me up and wanted
to know what was the matter with my face, it was
so bloody. Being a little George W., minus the
hatchet, I told him the truth. Suffice to say he laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
me across his knee and made me think a nest of
bumble bees were having a dance in the seat of my
breeches&mdash;or at least where the seat should have
been. I never had a pair of pants on up to that
time. Had worn nothing but a long white shirt
made of a flour sack after some of the "big bugs"
in Matagorda had eaten the flour out.</p>

<p>The fall of 1861 Mr. Hale broke up school and
left for Yankeedom to join the blue coats. And
from that time on I had a regular picnic, doing
nothing and studying mischief. Billy Williams was
my particular chum; we were constantly together
doing some kind of devilment. The old women
used to say we were the meanest little imps in the
Settlement, and that we would be hung before we
were twenty-one. Our three favorite passtimes
were, riding the milk calves, coon hunting and sailing
play-boats down on the bay shore.</p>

<p>Shortly after school broke up I wore my first
pair of breeches. Uncle "Nick" and aunt "Mary,"
mothers' brother and sister, who lived in Galveston,
sent us a trunk full of clothes and among them was
a pair of white canvas breeches for me.</p>

<p>The first Sunday after the goods arrived mother
made me scour myself all over and try my new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
pants on. They were large enough for two kids of
my size, but mother said I could wear them that
day if I would be a good boy, and that she would
take a few tucks in them before the next Sunday.
So after getting me fixed up she told me not to leave
the yard or she would skin me alive, etc.</p>

<p>Of course I should have been proud of the new
addition to my wardrobe and like a good little boy
obeyed my mother; but I wasn't a good little boy
and besides the glory of wearing white pants was
insignificant compared to that of an exciting coon
hunt with dogs through brush, bramble and rushes.
You see I had promised Billy the evening before
to go coon hunting with him that day.</p>

<p>I watched my chance and while mother was
dressing sister in her new frock I tiptoed out of
the house and skipped.</p>

<p>Billy was waiting for me with the four dogs and
off we went for the Bay shore.</p>

<p>Arriving there the dogs disappeared in the tall
rushes barking at every jump; we jumped right in
after them, up to our waists in the mud. We had
a genuine good all-day coon hunt, killing several
coons and one wild cat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>We gave up the hunt about sundown, and I
started for home, the glory of my new pants having
departed. I was indeed a sorry looking sight, covered
with mud from head to foot.</p>

<p>I entered the house with some fear and trembling,
and well I might, for mother was "laying" for me
with the old black strap. The result was I slept
sound that night, but couldn't sit down without pain
for a week afterwards.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">MY INTRODUCTION TO THE LATE WAR.</p>

<p>It was Monday morning&mdash;a day that I despised.
Need you wonder, for it was mother's wash day
and I had to carry wood from the Gulf beach to
keep the "pot boiling."</p>

<p>I tried to play off sick that morning but it would
not work, for mother had noticed that I got away
with two plates of mush besides three hard boiled
eggs for breakfast.</p>

<p>Before starting out after my first load of wood,
I hid the big old strap which hung by the door,
for I felt it in my bones there was war in the
air. I always did have a tough time of it on wash
days, and I knew this Monday would bring the
same old story.</p>

<p>At last mother got the fire started under the wash-pot
which stood out in the yard and told me for
about the twentieth time to go after an armful of
wood. I hesitated, in hopes that she would take a
notion to go herself, but when she stamped her foot
and picked up a barrel stave I knew I had better be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
going, for when she got her Irish blood up it was
dangerous to linger.</p>

<p>When I got out among the drift wood on the
beach, I treed a cotton-tail rabbit up a hollow log,
and I made up my mind to get Mr. cotton-tail out,
wood or no wood.</p>

<p>I began digging the sand away from the log as
fast as I could so as to be able to roll it down
into the Gulf and drown the rabbit out.</p>

<p>It was a very hot day and digging the heavy sand
with only my hands and a stick was slow, tiresome
work. The result was I fell asleep with my head
under the log and my bare legs sticking out in the
hot June sun. I dreamt I died and went to a dreadful
hot country and Satan was there piling hot coals
on me.</p>

<p>Finally the sun went under a cloud, or at least I
suppose it did, for the burning pain left me and I
began to dream of Heaven; I thought the Lord was
there sitting upon His throne of gold in the midst
of scores of happy children. Calling me up to him
he pointed to a large pile of fence rails down in a
beautiful valley and said: "my boy you go down and
carry every one of those rails up here to me before
you stop."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>His words landed up against my happy thoughts
like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. I had been
thinking of what a picnic I would have with the
other children.</p>

<p>A walk of about one mile brought me to the pile
of rails; there were more in the pile than I could
count, I shouldered one of the lightest and struck
out up the steep hill, thinking how I would like to
be back with mother, even if I had to carry an
armful of wood from the beach now and then.</p>

<p>When about half way up the hill I heard a terrible
noise such as I had never heard before, it awakened
me, and in trying to jump up I bumped my
head against the log, and also filled my eyes full of
sand.</p>

<p>When I got onto my feet and the sand out of
my eyes, I discovered the whole beach, east of me,
thronged with men carrying guns, and marching
right towards me. The head ones were not over a
hundred yards off, beating drums and blowing their
horns.</p>

<p>It is needless to say I was scared and that I
ran as fast as my legs could carry me, looking back
every minute to see if they were after me. It was
in this way that I ran or sprang right into the midst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of Mrs. Zipprian's drove of geese, before I knew
it. There were several old ganders in the drove
which used to chase me every chance they got. I
generally took particular pains to go around them;
but this time my mind was in a different channel
from what it had ever been in before, hence my not
looking out for them.</p>

<p>As I flew past, two of the old ganders made a dive
at me, but only one succeeded in catching on; he
grabbed the tail of my shirt, which stuck straight
out behind, in his mouth and hung on with blood in
his eyes. My speed seemed to increase instead of
slacken, every time the old gander would bounce
up and come down, his claws would rake the skin
from the calves of my legs. His death-like grip
finally broke loose and I felt considerable lighter.
My mind also, felt somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>Mother was out in the yard washing, she had
picked up chips enough to boil the water; the tub
was sitting upon a box and she was rubbing away
with all her might, her back towards me. As I was
looking over my shoulder I ran against her, knocking
her, tub and all over in a pile, myself with them.</p>

<p>Mother got up first with her right hand in my shirt
collar, I plead manfully, and tried to tell her about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the scores of men, but she was too mad to listen,
she dragged me to where the big black strap should
have hung, I knew she couldn't find it, therefore
hoped to get off with a few slaps, but alas, no she
spied the mush stick and the way she gave it to me
with that was a caution!</p>

<p>The crowd I saw proved to be Dr. Pierceson's
company of rebels, who had been sent over from
Matagorda to drill and be ready to fight the blue
coats when they came. It was then the summer of
1862. They located their camp on the beach, about
a mile from our house, and I used to march with
them all day long sometimes. The captain, Dr.
Pierceson, gave me an umbrella stick which I used
for a gun.</p>

<p>That coming fall about five thousand Yankees
landed at Deckrows Point on the Peninsula and
marched by our ranch on their way to the rebel
camp which was stationed forty miles above, at the
mouth of Caney Creek.</p>

<p>They camped one night close to our house and
filled me up with hard-tack, which was quite a treat
to a fellow living on mush and milk.</p>

<p>They had a five or six day fight with the rebels,
neither of them coming off victorious. We could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hear the guns plainly from the "Settlement." Many
dead men were washed ashore on the beach. My
sister and I stumbled onto one poor fellow one day,
shot through the heart. His clothes were gone and
his wrist was marked "J. T." in India ink.</p>

<p>After the battle the Yankees marched back to
Deckrows Point where they remained to the end of
the war; the rebels still held their ground at the
mouth of Caney. Every now and then a squad from
each side would meet at the "Settlement" and have a
skirmish. I remember once after one of those skirmishes
a crowd of Yankees rounded Mr. Williams
up on the prairie&mdash;Billy and I being with him&mdash;and
throwing their pistols in his face told him if they ever
found him so far from home again they would kill him.</p>

<p>Their threats didn't scare Mr. Williams the least
bit, for he afterwards slipped into their camp after
dark and stole eleven head of their best horses and
gave them to the rebels. But on his way back from
the rebel ramp, where he went to take the horses
they caught him and took him aboard of a Yankee
man-of-war to hang him. They had the rope around
his neck ready to swing him when the General turned
him loose, on account of his old age and bravery,
telling him never to be caught from home again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Fighting was going on nearly every day in sight
of us; sometimes the Yankee gun boats would get
into the Bay among the rebel boats, and at other
times they would fight across the narrow strip of
land, shooting right over the houses at one another.
Many of the cannon balls dropped on the prairie;
one of them at one time struck within a few feet of
Mr. Williams, almost burying him in the sand as it
plowed along on the ground. Poor fellow, he was
afterwards killed by one, he carried one home and
taking all the powder out of it, as he supposed, set
it out in the yard with the hole up, and then told Billy
to get him a coal of fire in the tongs. He thought
it would just flash a little.</p>

<p>I was present, and not liking the looks of it, crept
out behind the picket gate, a few yards away, and
peeped between the pickets.</p>

<p>The whole family was looking on to see the fun,
Mattie, one of the little girls, was sitting with her
arms around a dog's neck, within a few feet of it.</p>

<p>Billy, arriving with the coal, handed it to his
father who reached over and let it drop down into
the hole&mdash;where he had taken out the lead screw.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the coal hadn't reached the
hole when the thing exploded. For a few seconds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
everything was enveloped in smoke; when the
smoke disappeared sufficiently for me to see, the
whole sky seemed to be a blaze of fire, and finally
Mr. Williams emerged out of the heavy cloud of
smoke hopping on one leg.</p>

<p>A piece of the bomb-shell had taken off part of
one foot on the left leg and another piece had
plowed through the calf of his right leg; part of
one ear was also gone. He only lived a few days.</p>

<p>A piece of the shell took off one of the dog's
legs without even touching Mattie, the little girl
who had her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>Several pieces went through the house, and one
piece went through the picket gate right over my
head. The next day Billy and I found a large piece
sticking in the wall of an old vacant house a mile
from where it exploded.</p>

<p>During the war several ships were driven ashore
on the beach by the Yankee gun boats. The folks
at the "Settlement" would get all the plunder. One
ship was loaded with dry goods and from that time
on I wore breeches.</p>

<p>About a year after the war broke out the rebels
gathered up all the cattle on the Peninsula and drove
them to the mainland, where they were turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
loose with the thousands upon thousands of wild
cattle already over there. Their idea in doing so
was to keep the Yankees&mdash;whom they knew would
hold the lower part of the Peninsula, they having
the best gunboats&mdash;from getting fresh beef to eat.
There was only one cow left in the whole "Settlement"
and that was our old "Browny;" mother had
begged manfully for them to leave her, for she knew
we children would starve to death living on mush
straight.</p>

<p>When the war broke up everybody was happy.
We cheered for joy when Mr. Joe Yeamans brought
the good news from town.</p>

<p>Shortly after this all of the men and boys that
were large enough, went over to the mainland to
gather up the Peninsula cattle. On their arrival they
found it a bigger job than they had figured on, for
they were scattered over two or three hundred
miles of country and as wild as deer.</p>

<p>Billy and I thought it very hard that we could
not go and be Cow Boys too; but we had lots of fun
all by ourselves, for we had an old mule and two or
three ponies to ride, so you see we practiced riding
in anticipation of the near future, when we would
be large enough to be Cow Boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>After being gone about three months the crowd
came back, bringing with them several hundred
head of cattle, which they had succeeded in gathering.
Among them were about twenty head belonging
to mother.</p>

<p>The crowd went right back after more. This
stimulated Billy and I to become a crowd of Cow
Boys all by ourselves, therefore we put in most of
our time lassoing and riding wild yearlings, etc.
We hardly stayed at home long enough to get our
meals. Mother had to get her own wood in those
days, for sister had gone to school in Galveston.
Of course I always had to come home at night,
therefore mother would get satisfaction out of me
with the black strap or mush stick, after I was
snugly settled in bed, for my waywardness and
trifling habits.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1867, a cattle man by the name
of Faldien brought his family over to the Peninsula
for their health and rented part of our house to
live in.</p>

<p>After getting his wife and babies located in their
new quarters, he started back home, in Matagorda,
to make preparations for spring work, he
having to rig up new outfits, etc. He persuaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
mother to let me go with him, and learn to run
cattle. When she consented I was the happiest
boy in the "Settlement," for my life long wish was
about to be gratified.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">MY FIRST LESSON IN COW PUNCHING.</p>

<p>The next day after arriving in town, Mr. Faldien
sent me out to his ranch, twenty miles, on Big
Boggy. I rode out on the "grub" wagon with the
colored cook. That night, after arriving at the
ranch, there being several men already there, we
went out wild boar hunting. We got back about
midnight very tired and almost used up. Such a
hunt was very different from the coon hunts Billy
and I used to have at the "Settlement." Our dogs
were badly gashed up by the boars, and it was a
wonder some of us hadn't been served the same way.</p>

<p>In a few days Mr. Faldien came out to the ranch,
bringing with him several men. After spending a
few days gathering up the cow-ponies, which hadn't
been used since the fall before, we started for Lake
Austin&mdash;a place noted for wild cattle.</p>

<p>During the summer I was taken sick and had to
go home. I was laid up for two months with typhoid
fever. Every one thought I would die.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>That fall, about October, mother married a man
by the name of Carrier, who hailed from Yankeedom.
He claimed that he owned a farm in Michigan, besides
lots of other property.</p>

<p>He was very anxious to get back to his farm, so
persuaded mother to sell out lock, stock and barrel
and go with him.</p>

<p>She had hard work to find a buyer as money was
very scarce, but finally she got Mr. George Burkheart,
a merchant in Matagorda, to set his own
price on things and take them.</p>

<p>The house and one hundred and seventy-five
acres of land only brought one hundred and seventy-five
dollars. The sixty head of cattle that we had
succeeded in getting back from the mainland went
at one dollar a head and all others that still remained
on the mainland&mdash;thrown in for good
measure.</p>

<p>At last everything for sale was disposed of and
we got "Chris" Zipprian to take us to Indianola in
his schooner. We bade farewell to the old homestead
with tears in our eyes. I hated more than
anything else to leave old "Browny" behind for she
had been a friend in need as well as a friend indeed.
Often when I would be hungry and afraid to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
home for fear of mother and the mush stick, she
would let me go up to her on the prairie calf fashion
and get my milk. She was nearly as old as
myself.</p>

<p>At Indianola we took the Steamship "Crescent
City" for New Orleans. The first night out we ran
into a large Brig and came very near going under.
The folks on the Brig were nearly starved to death,
having been drifting about for thirty days without a
rudder. We took them in tow, after getting our
ship in trim again, and landed them safely in Galveston.</p>

<p>There was a bar-room on our ship, and our new
lord and master, Mr. Carrier, put in his spare time
drinking whisky and gambling; I do not think he
drew a sober breath from the time we left Indianola
until we landed in New Orleans, by that time he
had squandered every cent received for the homestead
and cattle, so mother had to go down into
her stocking and bring out the little pile of gold
which she had saved up before the war for "hard
times," as she used to say. With this money she
now bought our tickets to Saint Louis. We took
passage, I think, on the "Grand Republic." There
was also a bar-room on this boat, and after wheedling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
mother out of the remainder of her funds, he
drank whisky and gambled as before, so we landed
in Saint Louis without a cent.</p>

<p>Mother had to pawn her feather mattress and
pillows for a month's rent in an old delapidated
frame building on one of the back streets. It contained
only four rooms, two up stairs and two down;
the lower rooms were occupied by the stingy old
landlord and family; we lived in one of the upper
rooms, while a Mr. Socks, whose wife was an invalid,
occupied the other.</p>

<p>The next day after getting established in our new
quarters, the "old man," as I called him, struck out
to find a job; he found one at a dollar a day shoveling
coal.</p>

<p>At first he brought home a dollar every night,
then a half and finally a quarter. At last he got to
coming home drunk without a nickel in his pocket.
He finally came up missing; we didn't know what
had become of him. Mother was sick in bed at
the time from worrying. I went out several times
hunting work but no one would even give me a
word of encouragement, with the exception of an
old Jew who said he was sorry for me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>A little circumstance happened, shortly after the
"old man" pulled his trifling carcass for parts unknown,
which made me a better boy and no doubt
a better man than I should have been had it never
happened.</p>

<p>Everything was white without, for it had been
snowing for the past two days. It was about five
o'clock in the evening and the cold piercing north
wind was whistling through the unceiled walls of
our room. Mother was sound asleep, while sister
and I sat shivering over an old, broken stove, which
was almost cold, there being no fuel in the house.</p>

<p>Sister began crying and wondered why the Lord
let us suffer so? I answered that may be it was because
we quit saying our prayers. Up to the time
we left Texas mother used to make us kneel down
by the bed-side and repeat the Lord's prayer every
night before retiring. Since then she had, from
worrying, lost all interest in Heavenly affairs.</p>

<p>"Let us say our prayers now, then, brother!"
said sister drying the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>We both knelt down against the old, rusty stove
and commenced. About the time we had finished
the door opened and in stepped Mr. Socks with a
bundle under his arm. "Here children, is a loaf of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bread and some butter and I will bring you up a
bucket of coal in a few moments, for I suppose
from the looks of the stove you are cold," said the
good man, who had just returned from his day's work.</p>

<p>Was ever a prayer so quickly heard? We enjoyed
the bread and butter, for we hadn't tasted food
since the morning before.</p>

<p>The next day was a nice sunny one, and I struck
out up town to try and get a job shoveling snow
from the sidewalks.</p>

<p>The first place I tackled was a large stone front
on Pine street. The kind lady of the establishment
said she would give me twenty-five cents if I would
do a good job cleaning the sidewalk in front of the
house.</p>

<p>After an hour's hard work I finished, and, after
paying me, the lady told me to call next day and
she would give me a job shoveling coal down in the
cellar, as I had done an extra good job on the sidewalk.
This was encouraging and I put in the
whole day shoveling snow, but never found any
more twenty-five cent jobs; most I received for one
whole hour's work was ten cents, and then the old
fat fellow kicked like a bay steer, about the d&mdash;&mdash;d
snow being such an expense, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>From that time on I made a few dimes each day
sawing wood or shoveling coal and therefore got
along splendid.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention my first evening in Saint
Louis. I was going home from the bakery when I
noticed a large crowd gathered in front of a corner
grocery; I went up to see what they were doing.
Two of the boys had just gotten through fighting
when I got there; the store-keeper and four or five
other men were standing in the door looking on
at the crowd of boys who were trying to cap another
fight.</p>

<p>As I walked up, hands shoved clear to the bottom
of my pockets, the store-keeper called out, pointing
at me, "there's a country Jake that I'll bet can lick
any two boys of his size in the crowd."</p>

<p>Of course all eyes were then turned onto me,
which, no doubt, made me look sheepish. One of
the men asked me where I was from; when I told
him, the store-keeper exclaimed, "by gum, if he is
from Texas I'll bet two to one that he can clean out
any two boys of his size in the crowd."</p>

<p>One of the other men took him up and they
made a sham bet of ten dollars, just to get me to
fight. The two boys were then picked out; one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was just about my size and the other considerably
smaller. They never asked me if I would take a
hand in the fight until everything was ready. Of
course I hated to crawl out, for fear they might
think I was a coward.</p>

<p>Everything being ready the store-keeper called
out, "dive in boys!"</p>

<p>We had it up and down for quite a while, finally
I got the largest one down, and was putting
it to him in good shape, when the other one picked
up a piece of brick-bat and began pounding me on
the back of the head with it. I looked up to see
what he was doing and he struck me over one eye
with the bat. I jumped up and the little fellow took
to his heels, but I soon overtook him and blackened
both of his eyes up in good shape, before the
other boy, who was coming at full tilt could get there
to help him. I then chased the other boy back to
the crowd. That ended the fight and I received
two ginger-snaps, from the big hearted storekeeper,
for my trouble. I wore the nick-name of
"Tex" from that time on, during my stay in that
neighborhood; and also wore a black eye, where
the little fellow struck me with the bat, for several
days afterwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>About the middle of January mother received a
letter from the "old man," with ten dollars enclosed,
and begging her to come right on without delay as
he had a good job and was doing well, etc. He
was at Lebanon, Ill., twenty-five miles from the
city. The sight of ten dollars and the inducements
he held out made us hope that we would meet with
better luck there, so we packed up our few traps
and started on the Ohio and Mississippi railroad.</p>

<p>On arriving in Lebanon about nine o'clock at
night we found the "old man" there waiting for us.</p>

<p>The next morning we all struck out on foot,
through the deep snow, for Moore's ranch where
the "old man" had a job chopping cord wood. A
tramp of seven miles brought us to the little old log
cabin which was to be our future home. A few
rods from our cabin stood a white frame house in
which lived Mr. Moore and family.</p>

<p>Everything went on lovely for the first week,
notwithstanding that the cold winds whistled
through the cracks in our little cabin, and we had
nothing to eat but corn bread, black coffee and old
salt pork that Moore could not find a market for.</p>

<p>The first Saturday after getting established in our
new home the "old man" went to town and got on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a glorious drunk, squandered every nickel he could
rake and scrape; from that time on his visits to
town were more frequent than his trips to the
woods, to work. At last I was compelled to go to
work for Moore at eight dollars a month, to help
keep the wolf from our door, and don't you forget
it, I earned eight dollars a month, working out in
the cold without gloves and only half clothed.</p>

<p>Towards spring the "old man" got so mean and
good-for-nothing that the neighbors had to run him
out of the country. A crowd of them surrounded
the house one night, took the old fellow out and
preached him a sermon; then they gave him until
morning to either skip or be hung. You bet he
didn't wait until morning.</p>

<p>A short while afterwards mother took sister and
went to town to hunt work. She left her household
goods with one of the near neighbors, a Mr. Muck,
where they still remain I suppose, if not worn out.
But there was nothing worth hauling off except the
dishes. I must say the table ware was good; we
had gotten them from a Spanish vessel wrecked on
the Gulf beach during the war.</p>

<p>Mother found work in a private boarding house,
and sister with a Mrs. Bell, a miller's wife, while I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
still remained with Moore at the same old wages.</p>

<p>Along in June sometime I quit Moore on account
of having the ague. I thought I should have money
enough to take a rest until I got well, but bless you
I only had ninety cents to my credit, Moore
had deducted thirty-five dollars the "old man" owed
him out of my earnings. I pulled for town as mad
as an old setting hen. But I soon found work again,
with an old fellow by the name of John Sargent,
who was to give me eight dollars a month, board
and clothes and pay my doctor bills.</p>

<p>About the first of September mother and sister
went to Saint Louis where they thought wages
would be higher. They bade me good bye, promising
to find me a place in the city, so I could be
with them; also promised to write.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I quit Mr. Sargent with only
one dollar to my credit; and that I havn't got yet.
He charged me up with everything I got in the
shape of clothes, doctor bills, medicine, etc.</p>

<p>I then went to work for a carpenter, to learn the
trade, for my board, clothes, etc. I was to remain
with him three years. My first day's work was
turning a big heavy stone for him to grind a lot of
old, rusty tools on. That night after supper I broke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
my contract, as I concluded that I knew just as
much about the carpenter's trade as I wished to
know, and skipped for the country, by moonlight.</p>

<p>I landed up at a Mr. Jacobs' farm twelve miles
from town and got a job of work at twelve dollars
a month. I didn't remain there long though, as I
had a chill every other day regular, and therefore
couldn't work much.</p>

<p>I made up my mind then to pull for Saint Louis
and hunt mother and sister. I had never heard a
word from them since they left. After buying a
small satchel to put my clothes in and paying for a
ticket to the city, I had only twenty-five cents left
and part of that I spent for dinner that day.</p>

<p>I arrived in East Saint Louis about midnight with
only ten cents left. I wanted to buy a ginger-cake
or something, as I was very hungry, but hated to
as I needed the dime to pay my way across the
river next morning. I wasn't very well posted then,
in regard to the ways of getting on in the world, or
I would have spent the dime for something to eat,
and then beat my way across the river.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IV" id="Chapter_IV"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">MY SECOND EXPERIENCE IN ST. LOUIS.</p>

<p>Bright and early next morning I gave my dime
to the ferryman and pulled out for the bustling
city, where I was soon lost in the large crowd which
thronged the levee.</p>

<p>I left my satchel in a saloon and struck out to find
Mr. Socks, hoping he could give me some information
as to mother and sister's whereabouts, but I
was sadly disappointed, he had left that part of the
city in which he lived when I knew him.</p>

<p>I put in the rest of the day gazing through the
show windows, especially of the bakeries, at the
fat pies, cakes, etc., for I was getting very hungry,
my last meal being dinner the day before.</p>

<p>About dark I strolled up to a second-hand book
store and asked how much a bible, nearly new,
would bring? The man behind the counter told me
to bring it around and he would give whatever it
was worth. So I struck out after my satchel; I
hated the idea of parting with the book for it had
been presented to me by my late employer's mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Mrs. Moore, a nice old lady who had taken a liking
to me. But you know how it is when a fellow is
hungry, or would have known had you been in my
shoes.</p>

<p>I got twenty-five cents for the bible and immediately
invested fifteen cents of it in a mince pie.</p>

<p>That night I stowed myself away in an empty
dry goods box. I did not sleep well, and when I
did sleep it was to dream of snakes and other venomous
reptiles.</p>

<p>I put in the whole of the next day hunting work,
but failed to find it. I had bought a five cent ginger-cake
for my dinner and now I got a five cent pie
for my supper; this broke me flat and I had nothing
else that I could sell; so I put up for the night in a
pile of bailed hay, which was stacked up behind a
store.</p>

<p>The next morning I struck out again hunting
work, but this time on an empty stomach. About
two o'clock in the afternoon I found a hack driver
who said he wanted to hire a boy to take care of
his horses; he said he would not be going home
until about one o'clock that night and for me to wait
for him in front of the Court house on Fourth street.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as soon as dark came, I went to the appointed
place and staid there for fear my man
would conclude to go home earlier than he expected.
I was exceedingly happy when the long-looked
for hour drew near, for I thought it wouldn't
be long until I would have a good square meal and
a warm bed to sleep in.</p>

<p>About two o'clock, while leaning against a lamppost
gazing up and down Fourth street, a policeman
punched me in the ribs and told me to "hunt my
hole" and that if he caught me out again so late
at night he would put me in the cooler.</p>

<p>I pulled out across the street and waited until he
got out of sight, then I went back to my same old
stand, thinking that my man would certainly be
along in a few moments at the outside. Every hack
that drove by would cause me to have a spell of the
blues, until another hove in sight&mdash;soon to disappear
again. Finally about three o'clock my courage
and what few sparks of hopes that still remained,
wilted, for, an empty stomach and sitting up so late
had given me a terrible headache, which was almost
past endurance.</p>

<p>I was sitting on the edge of the sidewalk, with
my face buried in both hands, crying, when someone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
touched me on the shoulder. I was scared at
first for I thought it was a "peeler;" but my fears
vanished when I looked up into the gleaming countenance
of a small, red complexioned man, who
said in a pleasant tone:&mdash;"Is there anything I can
do for you my little man?"</p>

<p>His kindness proved too much for me, I burst
out crying and it was quite awhile before I could
tell him my trouble. He was terribly mad when I
told him how the hack man had served me; he told
me to watch for the hard-hearted wretch next day
and if I saw him to point him out and he would
teach him how to play jokes on innocent children.</p>

<p>He took me to his boarding place, a fancy restaurant,
right across the street; he said he was just
fixing to go to bed when he spied me across the
street, acting as though in trouble.</p>

<p>When he found out that I hadn't had a square
meal for three days he remarked that it was a d&mdash;d
shame and then told the night clerk, who appeared
to be half asleep, to have me a good supper fixed
up and to give me a good room. He then bid me
good night and started to bed, telling me to remain
there until I found work, if it was a month, that he
would arrange everything with the proprietor in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
morning before he went to work. I thanked him
with tears in my eyes, for his kindness.</p>

<p>I was so tired and sleepy that I never woke up
until nearly noon next day. After eating breakfast,
I struck out to hunt a job, but failed as usual.</p>

<p>Three days after, while out hunting work, I
stopped an old man and asked him if he knew
where I could find a job? He smiled and said:
"My boy this is the fourth time you have asked me
that same question in the last three days. You must
like my looks, for I have noticed you pass scores
of men without stopping them."</p>

<p>I told him I never tackled a man unless he had
a pleasing countenance, for I had been snapped up
short by so many; I also told him that I did not
remember asking him before.</p>

<p>He finally, after asking me a few questions, said:
"Follow me and I will find you work before I stop."</p>

<p>The first place we went into was the Planters'
House, on Fourth street, between Pine and Chestnut,
and he asked the clerk if they needed a bell
boy. "No," was the short answer he received.</p>

<p>He then asked where he could find the proprietor.
"Up in his room, No.&mdash;. on first floor," was the
answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>We found the "boss" busily writing. My new
friend plead my case like a dutch uncle and told him
if I didn't prove to be just what he recommended
me to be&mdash;a wide-awake, get-up-and-get, honest
boy, that he would pay all damages, etc.</p>

<p>That seemed to settle it, for I was told to go
down to the office and wait for orders.</p>

<p>I was too happy to live. I thanked the kind old
gentleman from the bottom of my heart and offered
to pay him for his trouble as soon as I earned some
money. He told me I could pay him for his trouble
by being a good boy.</p>

<p>After waiting a few minutes in the office, the proprietor
came down and made a bargain with me.
My wages were to be ten dollars a month. He
gave me one month's wages in advance, to buy
clean clothes with.</p>

<p>I was put on the forenoon watch which went on
duty at eight in the morning and came off at one in
the afternoon. There were five of us on at a time.</p>

<p>We would always make from twenty-five cents to
five dollars a day while on duty, for we hardly ever
went to wait on a person but what they would give
us something in the shape of money. Gamblers
generally gave us the most; sometimes a lot of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
them would get together in a room to play cards
and send down to the bar after their drinks and
may be send a ten or twenty dollar bill and tell the
bell boy to keep the change. With this money we
used to have some gay old times taking in the city
after coming off guard.</p>

<p>The next fall, nearly one year after landing at
the "Planters," I had a fight with one of the bell
boys, Jimmie Byron. He called me a liar and I
jumped aboard of him. When it was over with,
the clerk, Mr. Cunningham, called me up to the
counter and slapped me without saying a word.</p>

<p>I went right straight to my room, packed up my
"gripsack" and went to the proprietor for a settlement.</p>

<p>He was surprised and wanted to know what in
the world had gotten into me.</p>

<p>I told him the whole thing, just as it happened.
He tried to get me to stay but I was still mad and
wouldn't listen to him. I had made up my mind
to buy a pistol, come back and get square with Mr.
Cunningham for slapping me.</p>

<p>I left the house with eighteen dollars in my
pocket; jumped aboard of a street car and rode down
to the levee. I left my valise at a saloon and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
started back to find a gun store. I finally found one
and gave ten dollars for a fancy little ivory handled
five-shooter.</p>

<p>I then started for the "Planters" still as mad as an
old setting hen. I had not gone far when I came
across a large crowd gathered around one of those
knife rackets, where you pay a quarter for five rings
and try to "ring" a knife.</p>

<p>I watched the thing awhile and finally invested a
quarter. I got a little "Jim Crow" barlow the first
throw. That made it interesting, so I bought another
quarters worth, and another until five dollars
was gone. This did not satisfy me, so I kept on
until I didn't have a nickel left.</p>

<p>But wasn't I mad when I realized what I had
done! I forgot all about my other troubles and felt
like breaking my own head instead of Cunningham's.</p>

<p>I went to the levee and found out that the "Bart
Able" would start for New Orleans in a few minutes,
so I ran to get my satchel, not far off, determined
on boarding the steamer and remaining there until
kicked off. Anything to get nearer the land of my
birth, I thought, even if I had to break the rules
of a gentleman in doing so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Purser came around collecting fares,
I laid my case before him with tears in my eyes;
I told him I was willing to work&mdash;and hard, too, to
pay my fare. He finally, after studying awhile,
said, "Well go ahead, I'll find something for you
to do."</p>

<p>Everything went on lovely with me until one
evening when we stopped at a landing to take on
some freight, mostly grain. We pulled up by the
side of an old disabled steamer which was being
used for a wharf-boat and went to work loading.
The job given to me was sewing sacks when ever
one was found out of order.</p>

<p>There were two sets of men loading, one in the
stern and the other in the bow, and I was supposed
to do the sewing at both ends. When they came
across a holey sack, if I happened to be at the
other end they would holloa for me and I would go
running through the narrow passage way, leading
from one end to the other.</p>

<p>I was in the stern when the sound of my name
came from the other end; I grabbed my ball of
twine and struck out in a dog trot through the
passage the sides of which were formed of grain
piled to the ceiling. When about half way through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
I thought I heard my name called from the end I
had just left; I stopped to listen and while waiting,
being tired, I went to lean over against the wall of
sacked grain, but instead of a wall there was an
old vacated hatchway and over into that I went.
There being no flooring in the boat, there was
nothing but the naked timbers for my weary bones
to alight upon.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_V" id="Chapter_V"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A NEW EXPERIENCE.</p>

<p>The next day about noon I came to my senses.
I found myself all alone in a nice little room on
a soft bed. I tried to get up but it was useless; my
back felt as if it was broken. I couldn't think what
had happened to me. But finally the door opened
and in stepped a doctor, who explained the whole
matter. He said the captain, just as the boat was
fixing to pull out, was walking through the passage
way when he heard my groans down in the hold
and getting a lantern, ladder and help, fished me
out almost lifeless. I was in the captain's private
room and having the best of care. The back of my
head was swollen out of shape, it having struck on
one of the cross timbers, while my back landed
across another. The doctor said I owed my life to
the captain for finding me, "for," said he, "if you
had remained in there twenty minutes longer your
case would have been hopeless."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>At last we arrived in Memphis, Tenn. We had
been traveling very slowly on account of having to
stop at all the small landings and unload freight or
take on more.</p>

<p>After landing at Memphis I took a notion that a
little walk would help my lame back, so I struck
out along the river bank, very slowly.</p>

<p>During my walk I came across a drove of small
snipe, and having my pistol with me, I shot at
them. The pistol report attracted the attention of
two boys who were standing not far off. They
came over to me, and one of them, the oldest, who
was on crutches, having only one leg, asked how
much I would take for my "shooter?" I told him
I would take ten dollars for it, as I was in need of
money. He examined it carefully and then said:
"It's a trade buddy, but you will have to go up to
that little house yonder, to get the money, as I
havn't got that much with me."</p>

<p>The house he pointed out stood off by itself to
the right of the town, which was situated about a mile
from the river. The house in question being half a
mile off, I told him that I was too weak to walk that
far, on account of my back being out of whack.
"Well," said he, "you go with us as far as that big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sand hill yonder," pointing to a large red sand hill a
few hundred yards from where we stood, "and my
chum here, who has got two good legs, will run
on and get the money while we wait."</p>

<p>I agreed, not suspecting anything wrong and
when behind the sand hill, out of sight of the
steamboat landing, Mr. one-leg threw down on me
with my own "shooter" and ordered me to throw
up my hands. I obeyed and held mighty still while
the other young ruffian went through my pockets.
They walked off with everything I had in my
pockets, even took my valise key. I felt considerably
relieved, I can assure you, when the cocked
revolver was taken down from within a few inches
of my nose. I was in dread for fear his trembling
finger might accidently touch the trigger.</p>

<p>As soon as I was released I went right back to
the landing and notified a policeman who struck
out after them. But whether he caught them or not
I never knew, as the "Bart Able" steamed down the
river shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The same evening after arriving in New Orleans
the "Bart Able" pulled back, for Saint Louis, leaving
me there flat broke and among strangers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked terribly blue late that evening as I
walked up and down the crowded levee studying
what to do. I had already been to the Morgan
steamship landing and begged for a chance to work
my way to Texas, but met with poor success. I
could not hire out even if I had applied and got a
job, for my back was still stiff, so much so that I
couldn't stoop down without terrible pain.</p>

<p>That night I laid down under an old tarpaulin
which was spread over a lot of sugar.</p>

<p>After getting up and shaking the dust off next
morning, I went down the river about a mile where
scores of small boats were being unloaded.</p>

<p>Among them were several boat loads of oranges,
bananas, etc., which were being unloaded. In carrying
the bananas on shore the over ripe ones would
drop off. On those I made my breakfast, but I
wished a thousand times before night that I had not
eaten them, for Oh Lord, how my head did ache!</p>

<p>That night I went to sleep on a pile of cotton
bales&mdash;that is I tried to sleep, but my headache was
terrible, I could get but little repose.</p>

<p>The next morning I found there was a Morgan
steamship in from Texas, and I struck out to interview<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the captain in regard to a free ride to Texas.
But the old pot-bellied sinner wouldn't talk to me.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I began to grow weak from hunger
and my back ached badly. I sat down on an
old stove at the foot of Canal street and never moved
for three long hours.</p>

<p>Finally a well dressed old man about fifty years
of age, with an umbrella over his head, came out
of Couens' office, a small building a short distance
from where I sat, and walking up to me said, in a
gruff voice, "young man what are you sitting out
here in the sun for, so upright and stiff, as if nailed
to that old stove?"</p>

<p>I told him I was compelled to sit upright on
account of a lame back. In fact I laid my case before
him in full. He then said in a much more pleasant
voice: "My boy I'm going to make you an offer,
and you can take it or let it alone&mdash;just as you like.
I will give you four dollars a month to help my wife
around the house and at the end of four months
will give you a free pass to Texas. You see I am
agent for Couens' Red River line of boats and,
therefore, can get a pass cheap."</p>

<p>I accepted his offer at once and thanked him
with all my heart for his kindness. Being on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his way home, we boarded a Canal street car. It
was then almost sundown.</p>

<p>About a half hour's ride brought us within half
a block of our destination.</p>

<p>Walking up a pair of nicely finished steps at No.
18 Derbigny street, he rang a bell. A negro servant
whom he called "Ann," answered the call.
Everything sparkled within, for the house was furnished
in grand style. The old gentleman introduced
me to his wife as a little Texas hoosier that
had strayed off from home and was about to starve.</p>

<p>After supper "Miss Mary," as the servants called
Mrs. Myers and as I afterwards called her showed
me to the bath house and told me to give myself
an extraordinary good scrubbing.</p>

<p>I do not know as this improved my looks any, as
I hadn't any clean clothes to put on, my valise
having been stolen during my illness coming down
the river.</p>

<p>The next day Miss Mary took me to a clothing
house and fitted me out in fine style. I admired
all but the narrow brimmed hat and peaked toed
gaiters. I wanted a broad brimmed hat and star
top boots, but she said I would look too much like
a hoosier with them on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening I got a black eye. After Mr. Myers
came home from his work about four o'clock, we all
went out on the front steps to breathe the fresh air.
There being a crowd of boys playing at the corner
I asked Mr. and Mrs. Myers if I could go over and
watch them awhile. Both consented, but told me
not to stay long as they didn't want me to get into
the habit of mixing with the street loafers.</p>

<p>On arriving there all eyes were turned towards
me. One fellow yelled out, "Hello dandy, when
did you arrive!" and another one remarked, "He is
a stiff cuss&mdash;aint he?"</p>

<p>I concluded there was nothing to be seen and
turned back; just as I turned around a yellow negro
boy slipped up behind me and pulled my hair.
The white boys had put him up to it, no doubt.</p>

<p>I jumped aboard of him quicker than a flash and
forgot all about my sore back. It was nip and tuck
for awhile&mdash;we both being about the same size, but
I finally got him down and blooded his nose in
good shape. As I went to get up he kicked me
over one eye with his heavy boot. Hence the black
eye, which was swollen up in a few minutes to an
enormous size.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>I expected to get a scolding from Mr. and Mrs.
Myers, but they both gloried in my spunk for taking
my own part. They had witnessed the whole thing.</p>

<p>Somehow or another that fight took the kink out
of my back for from that time on it began to get
well. I am bothered with it though, to this day,
when I take cold or do a hard day's work.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VI" id="Chapter_VI"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter VI.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">ADOPTED AND SENT TO SCHOOL.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Myers had no children and after I
had been with them about a month, they proposed
to adopt me, or at least they made me
promise to stay with them until I was twenty-one
years of age.</p>

<p>They were to send me to school until I was seventeen
and then start me in business. They also
promised to give me everything they had at their
death.</p>

<p>So they prepared me for school right away. As
I was not very far advanced in book learning, having
forgotten nearly all that Mr. Hale taught me, they
thought I had better go to Fisk's public school until
I got a start.</p>

<p>I had not been going to this school long when I
had trouble with the lady teacher, Miss Finnely.
It happened thus: A boy sitting behind me, struck
me on the neck with a slate pencil, and when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
turned around and accused him of it he whispered,
"you lie." I gave him a lick on the nose that made
him bawl like a calf.</p>

<p>Of course the teacher heard it and called us up
to take our medicine.</p>

<p>She made the other boy hold out his hand first
and after giving him five raps told him to take his
seat.</p>

<p>It was then my time, and I stuck out my hand
like a little man. She gave me five licks and was
raising the rule to strike again when I jerked my
hand away, at the same time telling her that it
wasn't fair to punish me the most when the other
boy caused the fuss. She insisted on giving me a
little more so finally I held out my hand and received
five more licks and still she was not satisfied;
but I was and went to my seat. She told me two
or three times to come back but I would not do it,
so she sent a boy upstairs after Mr. Dyer, the gentleman
who taught the large boys.</p>

<p>I had seen Mr. Dyer try his hand on boys, at
several different times, therefore didn't intend to let
him get hold of me if I could help it. She saw me
looking towards the door, so she came over and
stood between me and it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard Mr. Dyer coming down the stairs; that
was enough; I flew for the door. I remember
running against something soft and knocking it
over and suppose it must have been Miss Finnely.
When I got to the street I pulled straight for home.</p>

<p>About a week afterwards Mr. Myers sent me to
pay school, where I was taught German, French and
English. My teacher was an old gentleman who
only took a few select scholars.</p>

<p>Everything went on fine until the following spring,
in May or June, when I got into a fuss with one of
the scholars and skipped the country.</p>

<p>The way it happened: One day when school let
out for dinner we all, after emptying our dinner baskets,
struck out for the "green" to play "foot and a
half."</p>

<p>There was one boy in the crowd by the name of
Stemcamp who was always trying to pick a fuss
with me. He was twice as large as I was, therefore
I tried to avoid him, but this time he called me
a liar and I made for him.</p>

<p>During the scuffle which followed, I got out my
little pearl handled knife, one "Miss Mary" had given
me just a few days before and was determined to
use it the first opportunity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>I was down on all fours and he astride of my
back putting it to me in the face, underhanded.
The only place I could get at with the knife was
his legs, so I stuck it in up to the handle, on the inside
of one leg, just below the groin and ripped
down.</p>

<p>He jumped ten feet in the air and roared out
"Holy Moses!"</p>

<p>As soon as I regained my feet he took to his
heels, but I soon overtook him and got another dig
at his back. I thought sure I had done him up for
good this time but found out afterwards that I had
done no harm, with the exception of ripping his
clothes down the back.</p>

<p>The next day at that time I was on my way to
Saint Louis. I had stowed myself away on board
of the "Mollie Able" among the cotton bales.</p>

<p>The second night out we had a blow up. One of
the cylinder-heads blew out of the engine. It
nearly killed the engineer and fireman, also several
other persons.</p>

<p>A little negro boy&mdash;who was stealing his passage&mdash;and
I were sleeping on a pile of lumber close to the
engine when she went off. We both got pretty
badly scalded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The steamer ran ashore and laid there until morning
and then went the balance of the way on one
wheel. It took us just eight days from that time to
get to Saint Louis.</p>

<p>I remained in Saint Louis one day without food&mdash;not
caring to visit the "Planters" or any of my acquaintances&mdash;and
then walked to Lebanon, Ill.,
twenty-five miles. I thought may be I might find
out through some of my Lebanon friends where
mother and sister were.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when I struck out on my journey
and nine o'clock at night when I arrived at my
destination. I went straight to Mrs. Bell's, where
sister had worked, but failed to hear a word of
mother and sister's whereabouts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell gave me a good bed that night and
next morning I struck out to hunt a job.</p>

<p>After considerable tramping around I found work
with one of my old employers, a Mr. Jacobs, who
lived twelve miles from town.</p>

<p>I only worked a short while when I began to wish
I was back under "Miss Mary's" wing. So one
morning I quit and pulled for Saint Louis.</p>

<p>I had money enough to pay my fare to Saint
Louis and I arrived there just as the "Robert E.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Lee" and "Natchez" were fixing to pull out on their
big race for New Orleans.</p>

<p>The "Robert E. Lee" being my favorite boat, I
jumped aboard just as she was shoving off. Of
course I had to keep hidden most of the time, especially
when the captain or purser were around.
I used to get my chuck from the cook who thought
I was a bully boy.</p>

<p>The "Natchez" would have beaten, no doubt, but
she got too smart by trying to make a cut-off through
an old canal opposite Memphis and got stuck in
the mud.</p>

<p>The first thing after landing in New Orleans, I
hunted up one of my boy friends and found out by
him how my victim was getting on. He informed
me that he was up and hobbling about on crutches.
He also stated that the poor fellow came very near
losing his leg. I concluded if they did have me
arrested that Mr. Myers was able to help me out, so
I braced up and struck out for home.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Myers were terribly tickled over
my return. They had an awful time though getting
me scrubbed up again, as I was very black and dirty.</p>

<p>A few days after my return Mr. Myers went to
see my same old teacher to find out whether he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
would take me back or not. At first he said that
no money could induce him to be bothered with me
again, but finally Mr. Myers talked him into the notion
of trying me once more.</p>

<p>So the next morning I shouldered my books and
struck out for school to take up my same old studies,
German, French and English.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">BACK AT LAST TO THE LONE STAR STATE.</p>

<p>Everything went on lovely until the coming fall,
about the latter part of November when I skipped
the country for good. I will tell you how it
happened.</p>

<p>One afternoon a fire broke out close to the school
house and as everybody was rushing by, I became
excited and wanted to go too, to see the fun. I
asked the teacher if I could go, but he refused in a
gruff voice. This did not keep me, I made a break
for the door and was soon lost among the surging
mass of people.</p>

<p>The next heard of me was on the "rolling deep."
I had boarded a Morgan steamship and stowed
myself away until the vessel was at sea, where I
knew they wouldn't land to put me ashore.</p>

<p>"St. Mary" was the name of the ship. She lost
one of her wheel houses and was considerably out
of shape when we landed in Galveston, Texas. It
had stormed terribly during the whole trip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>During the few hours that the ship remained in
Galveston, I put in my time hunting an old uncle
of mine by the name of "Nick" White, whom I
had never seen. He had been living there seventeen
years, therefore I experienced but little difficulty
in finding his place; but after finding it I
didn't have courage enough to go in and make myself
known. One reason was, I thought he might
think I was beholden to him, or in other words,
trying to get his sympathy. I just stood at the gate
a few minutes viewing the beautiful shrubbery,
which filled the spacious yard and went back to the
boat which by that time, was just fixing to pull out.</p>

<p>We arrived in Indianola one morning about sun-up.
I recognized several of my old acquaintances
standing on the wharf before the ship landed;
among them was my old God-father Mr. Hagerty,
who stood for me when I was being christened by
the Catholic priest.</p>

<p>They were all surprised to see me back. Mr.
Hagerty took me home with him and told me to
content myself until I could find work.</p>

<p>In about a week I went to work for Mr. H.
Selickson, who ran a packing house five miles below
town. He gave me fifteen dollars a month all winter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The first month's wages went for a fancy pistol,
the next, or at least part of it, for a pair of star topped
boots and all the balance on "monte," a mexican
game. There were lots of mexicans working there
and after working hours some of them would "deal"
monte while the rest of us "bucked."</p>

<p>About the first of February I quit the packing
house and went to Matagorda where I was welcomed
by all my old acquaintances. From there I
took a trip over to the "Settlement," on the Peninsula,
to see the old homestead. Everything looked
natural; the cedar and fig trees were covered with
little red winged black birds, seemingly the same
ones that were there when I left, nearly three years
before.</p>

<p>After a week's stay in the Settlement, I went back
to Matagorda and went to work for Mr. Joseph
Yeamans, a Baptist preacher. My work was farming
and my wages part of the crop.</p>

<p>Mr. Yeamans' farm was a thirty acre sand patch
on the Peninsula, about forty miles above the Settlement.
Our aim was to raise a big crop of water
melons and sweet potatoes, but when I left everything
pointed to a big crop of grass burrs and a very
slim lay out of sweet potatoes and water melons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman and I lived all alone in a little
delapidated shanty with a dirt floor. Our chuck
consisted of black coffee, hard-tack and coon or
'possum meat. We had three good coon dogs,
therefore had plenty of fresh meat such as it was.</p>

<p>There being plenty "Mavricks" close at hand,
and being tired of coon meat, I used to try and get
the old man to let me butcher one now and then for
a change, but he thought it wicked to kill cattle not
our own.</p>

<p>As some of you may not know what a "Mavrick"
is, I will try and explain.</p>

<p>In early days, a man by the name of Mavrick
settled on the Lavaca river and started a cow ranch.
He being a chicken-hearted old rooster, wouldn't
brand nor ear-mark any of his cattle. All his neighbors
branded theirs, therefore Mr. Mavrick claimed
everything that wore long ears.</p>

<p>When the war broke out Mr. Mavrick had to bid
adieu to wife and babies and go far away to fight
for his country's good.</p>

<p>When the cruel war was ended, he went home
and found his cattle roaming over a thousand hills.
Everywhere he went he could see thousands upon
thousands of his long-eared cattle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>But when his neighbors and all the men in the
surrounding country came home and went to branding
their five years increase, Mr. Mavrick did not
feel so rich. He made a terrible fuss about it, but
it did no good, as in a very few years his cattle
wore some enterprising man's brand and he was
left out in the cold.</p>

<p>Hence the term "Mavrick." At first people used
to say: "Yonder goes one of Mr. Mavrick's animals!"
Now they say: "Yonder goes a Mavrick!"</p>

<p>About the time we got our crops, sweet potatoes,
melons, etc., in the ground, I swore off farming
and skipped out for town, leaving Mr. Yeamans my
share of the "crop" free <i>gratis</i>.</p>

<p>After arriving in Matagorda I hired out to a Mr.
Tom Nie, who was over there, from Rancho Grande,
hiring some Cow Boys.</p>

<p>"Rancho Grande" was owned by "Shanghai" Pierce
and Allen and at that time was considered one of
the largest ranches in the whole state of Texas.
To give you an idea of its size, will state, that the
next year after I went to work we branded twenty-five
thousand calves&mdash;that is, just in one season.</p>

<p>Altogether there were five of us started to Rancho
Grande to work&mdash;all boys about my own age; we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
went in a sail boat to Palacious Point, where the
firm had an outside ranch and where they were
feeding a large lot of cow ponies for spring work.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of April, 1871, that we
all, about twenty of us, pulled out for the headquarter
ranch at the head of Tresspalacious creek.
It took us several days to make the trip as we had
to brand calves and Mavricks on the way up.</p>

<p>A few days after arriving at the ranch Mr. or
"Old Shang" Pierce as he was commonly called,
arrived from Old Mexico with about three hundred
head of wild spanish ponies, therefore we kids had
a high old time learning the art of riding a "pitching"
horse.</p>

<p>We put in several days at the ranch making preparations
to start out on a two months trip. Being
a store there we rigged up in good shape; I spent
two or three months' wages for an outfit, spurs, etc.,
trying to make myself look like a thoroughbred
Cow Boy from Bitter creek.</p>

<p>There were three crowds of us started at the same
time; one to work up the Colorado river, the other
around home and the third which was ours, to work
west in Jackson and Lavaca counties.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Our crowd consisted of fifteen men, one hundred
head of ponies&mdash;mostly wild ones&mdash;and a chuck
wagon loaded down with coffee, flour, molasses
and salt. Tom Nie was our boss.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VIII" id="Chapter_VIII"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">LEARNING TO ROPE WILD STEERS.</p>

<p>Arriving on the Navadad river, we went to work
gathering a herd of "trail" beeves and also
branding Mavricks at the same time. Some days
we would brand as high as three or four hundred
Mavricks&mdash;none under two years old.</p>

<p>After about a month's hard work we had the herd
of eleven hundred ready to turn over to Mr. Black
who had bought them, delivered to him at the
Snodgrass ranch. They were all old mossy horn
fellows, from seven to twenty-seven years old.</p>

<p>Mr. Black was a Kansas "short horn" and he had
brought his outfit of "short horn" men and horses,
to drive the herd "up the trail."</p>

<p>Some of the men had never seen a Texas steer,
consequently they crossed Red river into the Indian
territory with nothing left but the "grub" wagon
and horses. They had lost every steer and Mr.
Black landed in Kansas flat broke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Lots of the steers came back to their old ranges
and Mr. "Shanghai" had the fun of selling them
over again, to some other greeny, may be.</p>

<p>"Shanghai" Pierce went to Kansas the next year
and when he returned he told of having met Mr.
Black up there, working at his old trade&mdash;blacksmithing.
He said Mr. Black cursed Texas shamefully
and swore that he never would, even if he should
live to be as old as Isaac, son of Jacob, dabble in
long horns again.</p>

<p>After getting rid of Mr. Black's herd we turned
our whole attention to branding Mavricks.</p>

<p>About the first of August we went back to the
ranch and found that it had changed hands in our
absence. "Shanghai" Pierce and his brother Jonathan
had sold out their interests to Allen, Pool &amp; Co.
for the snug little sum of one hundred and ten
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>That shows what could be done in those days,
with no capital, but lots of cheek and a branding
iron. The two Pierce's had come out there from
Yankeedom a few years before poorer than skimmed
milk.</p>

<p>Everything had taken a change&mdash;even to the
ranch. It had been moved down the river four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
miles to Mr. John Moore's place. Mr. Moore had
been appointed "big chief," hence the ranch being
moved to his place.</p>

<p>About the middle of August we pulled out again
with a fresh supply of horses, six to the man and a
bran new boss, Mr. Wiley Kuykendall.</p>

<p>Some of the boys hated to part with Mr. Nie,
but I was glad of the change, for he wouldn't allow
me to rope large steers nor fight when I got on the
war-path. I remember one time he gave me fits for
laying a negro out with a four-year old club; and
another time he laid me out with his open hand for
trying to carve one of the boys up with a butcher
knife.</p>

<p>We commenced work about the first of September
on "Big Sandy" in Lavaca county, a place noted for
wild "brush" cattle. Very few people lived in that
section, hence so many wild unbranded cattle.</p>

<p>To illustrate the class of people who lived on Big
Sandy, will relate a little picnic a negro and I had
a few days after our arrival there.</p>

<p>While herding a bunch of cattle, gathered the
day before, on a small prairie, we noticed a
footman emerge from the thick timber on the opposite
side from where we were and make straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
for a spotted pony that was "hobbled" and grazing
out in the open space.</p>

<p>He was indeed a rough looking customer, being
half naked. He had nothing on his head but a
thick mat of almost gray hair; and his feet and legs
were bare.</p>

<p>We concluded to "rope" him and take him to
camp, so taking down our ropes and putting spurs
to our tired horses we struck out.</p>

<p>He saw us coming and only being about a hundred
yards from the spotted pony, he ran to him and
cutting the "hobbles," which held his two front legs
together, jumped aboard of him and was off in the
direction he had just come, like a flash. The pony
must have been well trained for he had nothing to
guide him with.</p>

<p>A four hundred yard race for dear life brought
him to the "brush"&mdash;that is timber, thickly covered
with an underbrush of live-oak "runners." He shot
out of sight like an arrow. He was not a minute
too soon, for we were right at his heels.</p>

<p>We gave up the chase after losing sight of him,
for we couldn't handle our ropes in the "brush."</p>

<p>The next day the camp was located close to the
spot where he disappeared at, and several of us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
followed up his trail. We found him and his three
grown daughters, his wife having died a short while
before, occupying a little one room log shanty in a
lonely spot about two miles from the little prairie in
which we first saw him. The whole outfit were
tough looking citizens. The girls had never seen
a town, so they said. They had about two acres
in cultivation and from that they made their
living. Their nearest neighbor was a Mr. Penny,
who lived ten miles west and the nearest town
was Columbus, on the Colorado river, fifty miles east.</p>

<p>As the cattle remained hidden out in the "brush"
during the day-time, only venturing out on the small
prairies at night, we had to do most of our work
early in the morning, commencing an hour or two
before daylight. As you might wish to know exactly
how we did, will try and explain:&mdash;About
two hours before daylight the cook would holloa
"chuck," and then Mr. Wiley would go around and
yell "breakfast, boys; d&mdash;&mdash;n you get up!" two or
three times in our ears.</p>

<p>Breakfast being over we would saddle up our
ponies, which had been staked out the night before,
and strike out for a certain prairie may be three or
four miles off&mdash;that is all but two or three men, just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
enough to bring the herd, previously gathered, on
as soon as it became light enough to see.</p>

<p>Arriving at the edge of the prairie we would dismount
and wait for daylight.</p>

<p>At the first peep of day the cattle, which would
be out in the prairie, quite a distance from the
timber, would all turn their heads and commence
grazing at a lively rate towards the nearest point of
timber. Then we would ride around through the
brush, so as not to be seen, until we got to the
point of timber that they were steering for.</p>

<p>When it became light enough to see good, we
would ride out, rope in hand, to meet them and apt
as not one of the old-timers, may be a fifteen or
twenty-year old steer, which were continuously on
the lookout, would spy us before we got twenty
yards from the timber. Then the fun would begin&mdash;the
whole bunch, may be a thousand head, would
stampede and come right towards us. They never
were known to run in the opposite direction from
the nearest point of timber. But with cattle raised
on the prairies, it's the reverse, they will always
leave the timber.</p>

<p>After coming in contact, every man would rope
and tie down one of the finest animals in the bunch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Once in awhile some fellow would get more beef
than he could manage; under those circumstances he
would have to worry along until some other fellow
got through with his job and came to his rescue.</p>

<p>If there was another prairie close by we would go
to it and tie down a few more, but we would have
to get there before sunup or they would all be in
the brush. It was their habit to graze out into the
little prairies at night-fall and go back to the brush
by sunrise next morning.</p>

<p>Finally the herd which we had gathered before
and which was already "broke in," would arrive
from camp, where we had been night-herding
them and then we would drive it around to each
one of the tied-down animals, letting him up so
he couldn't help from running right into the herd,
where he would generally stay contented. Once in
awhile though, we would strike an old steer that
couldn't be made to stay in the herd. Just as soon
as he was untied and let up he would go right
through the herd and strike for the brush, fighting
his way. Under those circumstances we would have
to sew up their eyes with a needle and thread. That
would bring them to their milk, as they couldn't see
the timber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>I got into several scrapes on this trip, by being a
new hand at the business. One time I was going at
full speed and threw my rope onto a steer just as he
got to the edge of the timber; I couldn't stop my
horse in time, therefore the steer went on one side
of a tree and my horse on the other and the consequence
was, my rope being tied hard and fast to the
saddle-horn, we all landed up against the tree in a
heap.</p>

<p>At another time, on the same day, I roped
a large animal and got my horse jerked over backwards
on top of me and in the horse getting up he
got me all wound up in the rope, so that I couldn't
free myself until relieved by "Jack" a negro man
who was near at hand. I was certainly in a ticklish
predicament that time; the pony was wild and there
I hung fast to his side with my head down while
the steer, which was still fastened to the rope, was
making every effort to gore us.</p>

<p>Just before Christmas Moore selected our outfit
to do the shipping at Palacious Point, where a
Morgan steamship landed twice a week to take
on cattle for the New Orleans market.</p>

<p>We used to ship about five hundred head at each
shipping. After getting rid of one bunch we would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
strike right back, to meet one of the gathering
outfits, after another herd. There were three different
outfits to do the gathering for us.</p>

<p>We kept that up all winter and had a tough time
of it, too, as it happened to be an unusually cold and
wet winter.</p>

<p>Towards spring the cattle began to get terribly
poor, so that during the cold nights while night-herding
them a great many would get down in the
mud and freeze to death. Have seen as high as
fifty head of dead ones scattered over the ground
where the herd had drifted during the night. It's a
pity if such nights as those didn't try our nerves.</p>

<p>Sometimes it would be twelve o'clock at night
before we would get the cattle loaded aboard of the
ship. But when we did get through we would surely
have a picnic&mdash;filling up on Mr. Geo. Burkheart's
red eye. Mr. Burkheart kept a store at the "Point"
well filled with Cow Boys delight&mdash;in fact he made
a specialty of the stuff.</p>

<p>Our camping ground was three miles from the
Point, and some mornings the cook would get up
and find several saddled horses standing around
camp waiting for their corn&mdash;their riders having
fallen by the wayside.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">OWNING MY FIRST CATTLE.</p>

<p>When spring opened, our outfit, under the leadership
of Mr. Robert Partin, Mr. Wiley having
quit, struck out up the Colorado river in Whorton
and Colorado counties to brand Mavricks.</p>

<p>About the last of July we went to the "home"
ranch, where Mr. Wiley was put in charge of us
again. We were sent right out on another trip,
west, to Jackson county.</p>

<p>It was on this trip that I owned my first cattle.
Mr. Wiley concluded it would look more business
like if he would brand a few Mavricks for himself instead
of branding them all for Allen, Pool &amp; Co.,
so he began putting his own brand on all the
finest looking ones. To keep us boys from giving
him away, he gave us a nest egg apiece&mdash;that is a
few head to draw to. My nest eggs were a couple of
two-year olds, and my brand was A. T. connected&mdash;the
T. on top of the A. Of course after that I
always carried a piece of iron tied to my saddle so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in case I got off on the prairie by myself I could
brand a few Mavricks for myself, without Mr. Wiley
being any the wiser of it. The way I would go about
it would be to rope and tie down one of the long-eared
fellows and after heating the straight piece of
round, iron bolt, in the brush or "cow-chip" fire,
"run" my brand on his hip or ribs. He was then my
property.</p>

<p>Everything ran along as smooth as if on greased
wheels for about two months, when somehow or
another, Mr. Moore, our big chief, heard of our
little private racket and sent for us to come home.</p>

<p>Mr. Wiley got the "G. B." at once and a Mr.
Logan was put in his place. Now this man Logan
was a very good man but he was out of his latitude,
he should have been a second mate on a Mississippi
steamboat.</p>

<p>I worked with Logan one trip, until we got back to
the ranch and then I settled up for the first time
since going to work, nearly two years before.</p>

<p>An old irishman by the name of "Hunky-dorey"
Brown kept the store and did the settling up with
the men. When he settled with me he laid all
the money, in silver dollars, that I had earned since
commencing work, which amounted to a few hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
dollars, out on the counter and then after
eyeing me awhile, said: "Allen, Pool &amp; Co. owe
you three hundred dollars," or whatever the amount
was, "and you owe Allen, Pool &amp; Co. two hundred
ninety-nine dollars and a quarter, which leaves you
seventy-five cents." He then raked all but six bits
into the money drawer.</p>

<p>To say that I felt mortified wouldn't near express
my feelings. I thought the whole pile was mine
and therefore had been figuring on the many purchases
that I intended making. My intentions were
to buy a herd of ponies and go to speculating. I
had a dozen or two ponies, that I knew were for
sale, already picked out in my mind. But my fond
expectations were soon trampled under foot. You
see I had never kept an account, consequently never
knew how I stood with the company.</p>

<p>After pocketing my six bits, I mounted "Fannie"
a little mare that I had bought not long before and
struck out for W. B. Grimes' ranch, a few miles up
the river. I succeeded in getting a job from the old
gentleman at fifteen dollars per month.</p>

<p>Mr. Grimes had a slaughter house on his ranch
where he killed cattle for their hides and tallow&mdash;the
meat he threw to the hogs. About two hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
head per day was an average killing. Did you ask
kind reader, if those were all his own cattle that he
butchered? If so, will have to say that I never
tell tales out of school.</p>

<p>After working around the ranch a short while Mr.
Grimes gave me the job of taking care of his "stock
horses," that is mares, colts and horses that wern't
in use. There were about two hundred head of
those and they were scattered in two hundred and
fifty different places&mdash;over fifty square miles of
territory and of course before I could take care of
them I had to go to work and gather them up into
one bunch.</p>

<p>A little circumstance happened shortly after going
to work at the "W. B. G." ranch which I am going
to relate.</p>

<p>An old gentleman by the name of Kinchlow, who
owned a large horse ranch up on the Colorado river
in Whorton county, came down and told Mr. Grimes
that his outfit was fixing to start on a horse "hunt"
and for him to send a man along, as there were
quite a number of "W. B. G." horses in that country.</p>

<p>As I had the job taking care of the horses, it fell
to my lot to accompany the old gentleman, Mr.
Kinchlow, to his ranch fifty miles distant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>It was bright and early one morning when we
pulled out, aiming to ride the fifty miles by ten
o'clock that night. Mr. Kinchlow was mounted on
"old Beauregard," a large chestnut sorrel, while I
rode a fiery little bay.</p>

<p>Our journey was over a bald, wet prairie; night
overtook us at the head of Blue creek, still twenty
miles from our destination.</p>

<p>A few minutes after crossing Blue creek, just
about dusk, we ran across a large panther, which
jumped up out of the tall grass in front of us. It
was a savage looking beast and appeared to be on
the war-path. After jumping to one side it just sat
still, growling and showing its ugly teeth. I started
to shoot it but Mr. Kinchlow begged me not to as
it would frighten his horse, who was then almost
beyond control, from seeing the panther.</p>

<p>We rode on and a few minutes afterwards discovered
the panther sneaking along after us through
the tall grass. I begged Mr. Kinchlow to let me
kill it, but he wouldn't agree, as, he said, a pistol
shot would cause old Beauregard to jump out of
his hide.</p>

<p>It finally became very dark; our guide was a
certain bright little star. We had forgotten all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
about the panther as it had been over half an hour
since we had seen it. The old man was relating an
indian tale, which made my hair almost stand on
end, as I imagined that I was right in the midst of
a wild band of reds, when all at once old Beauregard
gave a tremendous loud snort and dashed
straight ahead at a break-neck speed. Mr. Kinchlow
yelled "whoa," every jump; finally his voice died
out and I could hear nothing but the sound of his
horse's hoofs, and finally the sound of them too,
died out.</p>

<p>Of course I socked spurs to my pony and tried
to keep up, for I imagined there were a thousand
and one indians and panthers right at my heels.</p>

<p>After running about a quarter of a mile I heard
something like a faint, human groan, off to my right
about fifty yards. I stopped and listened, but could
not hear anything more, except now and then the
lonely howl of a coyote off in the distance. I
finally began to feel lonesome, so I put spurs to my
pony again. But I hadn't gone only a few jumps
when I checked up and argued with myself thusly:&mdash;Now
suppose that groan came from the lips of Mr.
Kinchlow, who may-be fell from his horse and is
badly hurt; then wouldn't it be a shame to run off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and leave him there to die when may be a little aid
from me would save him?</p>

<p>I finally spunked up and drawing my pistol started
in the direction from whence came the groan.
My idea in drawing the pistol was, for fear the
panther, who I felt satisfied had been the cause of
the whole trouble, might tackle me. Suffice it to
say that I found the old gentleman stretched out on
the ground apparently lifeless and that a half hour's
nursing brought him to. He finally after several
trials, got so he could stand up, with my aid. I
then helped him into my saddle, while I rode behind
and held him on and we continued our journey
both on one horse. He informed me after he came
to his right senses, that old Beauregard had fallen
and rolled over him.</p>

<p>We landed at our destination about ten o'clock
next morning; but the good old man only lived
about two weeks afterwards. He died from the
effects of the fall, so I heard.</p>

<p>About Christmas I quit Mr. Grimes and went to
work on my own hook, skinning "dead" cattle and
adding to the nest egg Mr. Wiley gave me. I put
my own brand on quite a number of Mavricks while
taking care of Mr. Grimes' horses, which began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
make me feel like a young cattle king. The only
trouble was they were scattered over too much wild
territory and mixed up with so many other cattle.
When a fellow branded a Mavrick in those days it
was a question whether he would ever see or realize
a nickel for it. For just think, one, or even a
hundred head mixed up with over a million of cattle,
and those million head scattered over a territory
one hundred miles square and continually drifting
around from one place to another.</p>

<p>After leaving Daddy Grimes I made my home
at Mr. Horace Yeamans', an old mexican war veteran,
who lived five miles from Grimes'. His
family consisted of two daughters and two sons, all
grown but the youngest daughter, Sally, who was
only fourteen, and who I was casting sheeps eyes
at. The old gentleman had brought his children up
very pious, which was a glorious thing for me as,
during the two years that I made my home there,
I got broke of swearing&mdash;a dirty, mean habit which
had fastened itself upon me, and which I thought was
impossible to get rid of. I had become so that it
was almost an impossibility for me to utter a sentence
without using an oath to introduce it and
another to end it. To show how the habit was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fastened upon me: Mr. Parten, one of my former
bosses, made me an offer of three dollars more
wages, on the month, if I would quit cursing but I
wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>Horace Yeamans, who was about my own age
and I went into partnership in the skinning business.
Cattle died by the thousands that winter, on account
of the country being overstocked, therefore Horace
and I had a regular picnic skinning, and branding
Mavricks&mdash;only those that looked as if they might
pull through the winter.</p>

<p>To give you an idea how badly cattle died that
winter will state that, at times, right after a sleet,
a man could walk on dead animals for miles without
stepping on the ground. This, of course, would be
along the Bay shore, where they would pile up on
top of one another, not being able to go further, on
account of the water.</p>

<p>About five miles east of Mr. Yeamans' was a
slough or creek called "Turtle bayou" which lay east
and west a distance of several miles, and which I
have seen bridged over with dead cattle, from one
end to the other. You see the solid mass of half
starved animals, in drifting ahead of a severe
"Norther," would undertake to cross the bayou,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
which was very boggy and consequently the weakest
ones would form a bridge for the others to cross on.</p>

<p>My share of the first hides we shipped to Indianola
amounted to one hundred and fourteen
dollars. You bet I felt rich. I never had so much
money in all my life. I went at once and bought
me a twenty-seven dollar saddle and sent mother
twenty-five dollars. I had found out mother's address,
in Saint Louis, by one of my old Peninsula
friends getting a letter from sister.</p>

<p>Our next sale amounted to more than the first.
That time Horace and I went to Indianola with the
hides for we wanted to blow in some of our surplus
wealth; we were getting too rich.</p>

<p>When spring opened I bought five head of horses
and thought I would try my hand at trading horses.
The first trade I made, I cleared twenty-five dollars.
I gave an old mare which cost me twenty dollars,
for a pony which I sold a few days afterwards for
forty-five.</p>

<p>Along in May I fell head over heels in love, for
the first time in my life. A pretty little fourteen
year old Miss, cousin to Horace and the girls, came
over on a month's visit and when she left I was completely
rattled&mdash;couldn't think of anything but her;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
her beautiful image was continually before my eyes.</p>

<p>Her father, who was Sheriff of Matagorda county
lived on the road to Matagorda, fifteen miles from
Mr. Yeamans', therefore, during the coming summer
I went to town pretty often; to get a new brand
recorded was generally my excuse. You see, as
she lived about half way between the Yeamans'
ranch and town, I could be near her two nights
each trip, one going and one returning.</p>

<p>I had very poor success that summer in my new
enterprise, horse trading. I was too badly "locoed"
to tell a good horse from a bad one; in fact I wasn't
fit for anything, unless it would have been a Mail
carrier between "Denning's Bridge" and Matagorda.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A START UP THE CHISHOLM TRAIL.</p>

<p>I put in the following winter branding Mavricks,
skinning cattle and making regular trips to Matagorda;
I still remained in partnership with Horace
Yeamans in the skinning business. I made considerable
money that winter as I sold a greater number
of Mavricks than ever before. But the money
did me no good as I spent it freely.</p>

<p>That coming spring, it being 1874, I hired to
Leander Ward of Jackson county to help gather a
herd of steers for the Muckleroy Bros., who were
going to drive them to Kansas. I had also made a
contract with Muckleroy's boss, Tom Merril, to go
up the trail with him, therefore I bid my friends
good-bye, not expecting to see them again until the
coming fall. My wages were thirty-five dollars per
month and all expenses, including railroad fare back
home.</p>

<p>After a month's hard work we had the eleven hundred
head of wild and woolly steers ready to turn over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to the Muckleroy outfit at Thirteen mile point on
the Mustang, where they were camped, ready to
receive them. Their outfit consisted mostly of
Kansas "short horns" which they had brought back
with them the year before.</p>

<p>It was a cold, rainy evening when the cattle were
counted and turned over to Tom Merril. Henry
Coats, Geo. Gifford and myself were the only boys
who were turned over with the herd&mdash;that is kept
right on. We were almost worn out standing night
guard half of every night for the past month and
then starting in with a fresh outfit made it appear
tough to us.</p>

<p>That night it began to storm terribly. The herd
began to drift early and by midnight we were five
or six miles from camp. The steers showed a disposition
to stampede but we handled them easy and
sang melodious songs which kept them quieted.
But about one o'clock they stampeded in grand
shape. One of the "short horns," a long legged
fellow by the name of Saint Clair got lost from the
herd and finally when he heard the singing came
dashing through the herd at full speed yelling "let
'em slide, we'll stay with'em!" at every jump.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>They did slide sure enough, but he failed to "stay
with 'em." For towards morning one of the boys
came across him lying in the grass sound asleep.
When he came dashing through the herd a stampede
followed; the herd split up into a dozen different
bunches&mdash;each bunch going in a different direction.
I found myself all alone with about three hundred
of the frightened steers. Of course all I could do
was to keep in front or in the lead and try to check
them up. I finally about three o'clock got them
stopped and after singing a few "lullaby" songs they
all lay down and went to snoring.</p>

<p>After the last steer dropped down I concluded I
would take a little nap too, so locking both legs
around the saddle-horn and lying over on the tired
pony's rump, with my left arm for a pillow, while
the other still held the bridle-reins, I fell asleep. I
hadn't slept long though when, from some unaccountable
reason, every steer jumped to his feet at
the same instant and was off like a flash. My pony
which was sound asleep too, I suppose, became
frightened and dashed off at full speed in the opposite
direction. Of course I was also frightened
and hung to the saddle with a death grip. I was
unable to raise myself up as the pony was going so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
fast, therefore had to remain as I was, until after
about a mile's run I got him checked up.</p>

<p>Just as soon as I got over my scare I struck out
in a gallop in the direction I thought the cattle had
gone, but failed to overtake them. I landed in
camp almost peetered out about nine o'clock next
morning. The rest of the boys were all there, just
eating their breakfast. Tom Merril and Henry
Coats had managed to hold about half of the herd,
while the balance were scattered and mixed up with
"range" cattle for twenty miles around.</p>

<p>After eating our breakfast and mounting fresh
horses we struck out to gather up the lost steers.
We could tell them from the range cattle by the
fresh "road" brand&mdash;a brand that had been put
on a few days before&mdash;therefore, by four o'clock
that evening we had all but about one hundred head
back to camp and those Leander Ward bought
back at half price&mdash;that is he just bought the road
brand or all cattle that happened to be left behind.</p>

<p>On arriving at camp, we all caught fresh horses
before stopping to eat dinner or supper, whichever
you like to call it, it being then nearly night. The
pony I caught was a wild one and after riding up
to camp and dismounting to eat dinner, he jerked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
loose from me and went a flying with my star-spangled
saddle.</p>

<p>I mounted a pony belonging to one of the other
boys and went in hot pursuit. I got near enough
once to throw my rope over his rump and that was
all. After a run of fifteen miles I gave it up as a
bad job and left him still headed for the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>I got back to camp just at dark and caught a
fresh horse before stopping to eat my supper. It
was still raining and had kept it up all day long.
Mr. "Jim" Muckleroy had an extra saddle along
therefore I borrowed it until I could get a chance
to buy me another one.</p>

<p>After eating a cold supper, the rain having put
the fire out, I mounted and went on "guard," the
first part of the night, until one o'clock, being
my regular time to stay with the herd, while the
last "guard" remained in camp and slept.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock it began to thunder and lightning,
which caused the herd to become unruly.
Every time a keen clash of thunder would come the
herd would stampede and run for a mile or two before
we could get them to stop. It continued in that
way all night so that we lost another night's rest;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
but we managed to "stay with 'em" this time; didn't
even loose a steer.</p>

<p>That morning we struck out on the trail for Kansas.
Everything went on smoothly with the exception
of a stampede now and then and a fuss with
Jim Muckleroy, who was a regular old sore-head.
Charlie, his brother was a white man. Where the
trouble began, he wanted Coats and I, we being
the only ones in the crowd who could ride wild
horses&mdash;or at least who were willing to do so, to
do the wild horse riding for nothing. We finally
bolted and told him that we wouldn't ride another
wild horse except our regular "mount," unless he
gave us extra pay. You see he expected us to ride
a horse a few times until he began to get docile and
then turn him over to one of his muley pets while
we caught up a fresh one.</p>

<p>At High Hill in Fayette county I got the bounce
from old Jim and a little further on Coats got the
same kind of a dose; while nearing the northern
state-line Geo. Gifford and Tom Merril, the boss,
were fired; so that left old Jim in full charge. He
hired other men in our places. He arrived in
Wichita, Kansas with eight hundred steers, out of
the eleven hundred we started with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>After leaving the outfit I rode to the Sunset railroad
at Shusenburg and boarded a train for Columbus
on the Colorado river. "Pat" Muckleroy,
Charlie's son, who was about eighteen years old,
quit and went with me. His home was in Columbus
and he persuaded me to accompany him and have
a good time.</p>

<p>On arriving in Columbus I went with Pat to his
home where I remained during my stay in that
place. I found Mrs. M., Pat's mother, to be a kind-hearted
old lady, and I never shall forget the big,
fat apple cobblers she used to make; she could beat
the world making them. There were also two young
Misses in the family, Nannie and Mary, who made
time pass off pleasantly with me.</p>

<p>It being seventy-five miles to Tresspalacious and
there being no railroad nearer than that, I had to
wait for a chance to get home. I could have bought
a horse and saddle when I first struck town but after
remaining there a week I began to get light in the
pocket, for it required quite a lot of money to keep
up my end with the crowd that Pat associated with.</p>

<p>At last after about a three weeks stay, I struck
Asa Dawdy, an old friend from Tresspalacious.
He was there with a load of stock and was just fixing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to load them on the cars to ship them to Galveston
when I ran afoul of him. He had sold his
saddle and was going to put his pet pony, one that
he wouldn't sell, into a pasture until some other
time when he happened up there. So you see I was
in luck, he turned the pony over to me to ride
home on.</p>

<p>After buying and rigging up a saddle I left town
flat broke. I spent my last dime for a glass of
lemonade just before leaving. Thus ended my first
experience on the "trail."</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">BUYS A BOAT AND BECOMES A SAILOR.</p>

<p>A three days' ride brought me to Grimes' ranch
where I hoped to strike a job, but the old
gent' informed me that he was full handed&mdash;had
more men than he really needed. But he offered
me a job cutting cord wood at a dollar a cord until
there should be an opening for me, which he
thought would be when the branding outfit arrived
from Jackson county where it had gone quite a
while before.</p>

<p>"Cutting cord wood" sounded tough to me, but
I finally agreed to try it a round or two, for I hated
the idea of being "busted." Mr. Grimes was to advance
me about two weeks provisions on "tick," so
I concluded I couldn't lose anything&mdash;unless it was
a few pounds of muscle and I had grave doubts
about that, for I knew my failing when it came to
dabbling in wood.</p>

<p>Before launching out into the wood business I
borrowed a horse and struck out to hunt up old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Satan so that I could ride around and find easy
trees to cut down; I found him about thirty miles
from Grimes' ranch; he was fat and wild; I had to
get help to put him in a corral and when I mounted
him he pitched like a wolf. He had forgotten that
he had ever been ridden.</p>

<p>The "wood camp" was three miles from the ranch
in a thinly timbered bottom. I had to camp all by
myself, which made it a disagreeable job.</p>

<p>The first day, after locating camp, was spent in
building a kind of Jim Crow shanty out of rotten
logs&mdash;was saving my muscle to cut cord wood.</p>

<p>Next morning bright and early I mounted Satan
and rode around hunting some easy trees&mdash;ones
that I thought would cut nicely. I marked about
a dozen and went back to camp, it being noon by
that time.</p>

<p>After dinner I lay down to take a nap until
evening when it would be cooler. About five o'clock
I rolled up my sleeves and waded into a small, sickly
pin-oak tree and the way chips flew for half an
hour was a caution. I then put in the balance of
the evening cording it up&mdash;that is what I had cut.
It lacked considerable of being half a cord, but
I filled in a lot of rotten chunks to make it pan out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
fifty cents worth. I slept sound that night for I
was tired.</p>

<p>Bright and early next morning I shouldered my
axe and struck out to tackle another sickly pin-oak
tree. While spitting on my hands and figuring on
how many licks it would take to down the little sapling,
I spied a large coon in a neighboring live-oak.
Now catching coons, you all know by this time was
a favorite passtime with me, so dropping the axe I
went for him. By the time I got part of him
cooked it was noon; and after dinner I fell asleep
and dreamt happy dreams until after sundown. After
supper I went turkey hunting and killed a fat
gobbler. Thus ended my third day in a wood camp.</p>

<p>I became tired of the cord wood business after
two weeks time. It was too lonesome a work for
a boy of my restless disposition. I mounted Satan
one morning after devouring the last speck of grub
in camp and struck out for the ranch. On my arrival
there Mr. Grimes asked me how much wood I had?
I told him I thought there was enough to balance
my grub bill. He said all right, he would send a
man up there with me next morning to measure it.
I finally informed him that it wasn't in shape for
measuring, with the exception of half a cord that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
cut the first day, as it was scattered over a vast
territory, two or three sticks in a place.</p>

<p>I suppose he balanced my grub bill as he has
never presented it yet.</p>

<p>Just then I came across a factory hand, John
Collier by name, who had a boat for sale. He had
bought it for a pleasure boat but found he couldn't
support such a useless piece of furniture. He
offered it to me for forty dollars and he had paid
one hundred for it. I tried to sell Satan so as to
buy it, but no one would have him as a gift, as they
said they would have to get their lives insured before
mounting him.</p>

<p>I wanted the boat, but how to get her I did not
know. I finally studied up a scheme: Mr. Collier
wanted to buy a horse in case he sold the boat, so
I began talking horse trade. Nothing but a gentle
animal would suit he said. I then described one to
him and asked how much he would take to-boot if
the pony proved to be as I represented? "Ten dollars"
said he; "she pops" continued I. So I started
over to Cashe's creek to trade Horace Yeamans out
of an old crippled pony that he couldn't get rid of.
He was a nice looking horse and apparently as
sound as a dollar; but on trotting him around a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
short while he would become suddenly lame in both
of his front legs.</p>

<p>Before starting to Cashe's creek next morning
Mr. Collier told me to try and get the horse there
that night as, in case we made the trade, he and
Mr. Murphy would start next morning on a pleasure
trip to Columbia, a town forty miles east. I assured
him that I would be back by dark. You see, that
was a point gained, making the trade after dark.</p>

<p>I succeeded in making the trade with Horace; he
gave me "old gray" as he called him and fourteen
dollars in money for my interest in three different
brands of cattle. He afterwards sold the cattle for
enough to buy a whole herd of crippled ponies.</p>

<p>I rode back to Grimes' ranch very slowly so as
not to cause old gray to become lame.</p>

<p>I arrived there about sundown, but remained out
in the brush until after dark.</p>

<p>Mr. Collier, on being notified of my arrival,
came out, lantern in hand, bringing his friend
Murphy along to do the judging for him. He confessed
that he was a very poor judge of a spanish
pony, not having been long in America. He was
from "Hengland."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>After examining old gray all over they both pronounced
him a model of beauty&mdash;an honor to the
mustang race. You see, he was hog fat, not having
been used for so long.</p>

<p>The trade was sealed that night and next morning
Mr. Collier and Murphy, who already had a
pony of his own, started on their forty mile journey.
When within five miles of Elliott's ferry on the
Colorado river, which was fifteen miles from Grimes'
old gray gave out entirely, so that poor Collier had
to hoof it to the ferry where he secured another
horse.</p>

<p>Now kind reader you no doubt think that a
shabby trick. If so, all I can say is "such is life
in the far west."</p>

<p>Now that I was owner of a ship I concluded it
policy to have a partner for company if nothing
more, so I persuaded a young factory hand by the
name of Sheiseinhamer or some such name to go
in with me in my new enterprise. He only had
ten dollars to invest, therefore I held the controlling
interest.</p>

<p>Our ship was schooner-rigged and would carry
about three tons. Her name was "Great Eastern"
but we changed it to "The Blood Hound."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned Satan loose to rustle for himself (I afterwards
sold him to a <i>stranger</i> for thirty dollars) and
then pulled down the river for Matagorda Bay, a
distance of fifteen miles.</p>

<p>I concluded to go to the Peninsula and buy a load
of melons that trip, as there were none on Tresspalacious.</p>

<p>We struck the Bay just at dark; the water was
terribly rough and the wind was so strong that it
made the Blood Hound dip water and slide along as
though it was fun. My young pard, who had never
been on salt water before, having been raised in
Saint Louis, turned pale behind the gills and wanted
to turn back when the low streak of land behind us
began to grow dim. But as I owned the controlling
interest in the ship, I told him he would have to
grin and bear it. He swore that would be his last
trip and it was. He sold me his interest on the
way back for eight dollars; he lost just two dollars
besides his time in the speculation.</p>

<p>Finally we hove in sight of the light house at
Salura Pass. Then we were all right for I could
tell just where to head for, although I hadn't been
on the Bay much since leaving there in '67. But I
had learned it thoroughly before then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>It was fifteen miles across the Bay to Fred Vogg's
landing, where I had concluded to land. We arrived
there about midnight and next morning walked up
to Mr. Vogg's house, about half a mile for breakfast.
The whole family were glad to see me&mdash;for
the first time in eight years.</p>

<p>I bought a load of melons delivered at the landing
for five cents a head&mdash;or piece I should have
said.</p>

<p>The next evening we started back home, and
arrived at Grimes' just as the whistle was tooting
for dinner, next day. The whole crowd of factory
hands, there being about seventy-five, made a
break for the boat to fill up on melons. The largest
I sold at fifty cents and the smallest at twenty-five.
By night I had sold entirely out and started back
after another load, all by myself this time, with the
exception of a dog, a stray that I had picked up.</p>

<p>I bought my melons at a different place this time,
from a Mr. Joe Berge who lived a few miles above
Mr. Vogg. I got them for two and a half cents a
piece, therefore made a better "speck" than before.
I struck a terrible storm on my return trip and came
very near swamping.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>I made my next trip to Indianola as I had four
passengers to take down, at two dollars and a half
a head.</p>

<p>Shortly after landing in Indianola I got two passengers,
one of them a pretty young lady, Miss
Ruthie Ward, to take to Sand Point in Lavaca
county, just across the Bay from Indianola.</p>

<p>I remained in Indianola two days "bucking"
monte. I left there broke after paying for a load
of melons.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XII" id="Chapter_XII"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XII.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">BACK TO MY FAVORITE OCCUPATION, THAT OF A WILD AND WOOLLY
COW BOY.</p>

<p>When the oyster season began, I abandoned
the melon trade in favor of the former.</p>

<p>I would load up at one of the many oyster reefs
in the Bay and take them either to the factory or
Indianola where they sold for one dollar a barrel,
in the shell.</p>

<p>Along in October sometime, I worked up a
scheme by which I thought I could make a stake.
My scheme was to get into the Colorado river
where there were no boats and speculate among the
africans that lined the river banks on both sides just
as far up as it was navigable, which was fifty miles
or more.</p>

<p>The worst job was to get the boat into the river,
the mouth of it being stopped up with a raft, or "drift"
about eighteen miles long.</p>

<p>My only show was to snake her across the prairie
from the head of Willson's creek, a distance of five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
miles&mdash;and that I concluded to do if it took all the
oxen in Matagorda county.</p>

<p>As I needed a partner in my new enterprise, I
managed to find one in the person of an old irishman
by the name of "Big Jack." He only had a
capital of eighteen dollars but I agreed to give him
half of the profits&mdash;which I figured on being very
large. You see my intentions were to swap for
hides, pecans, etc., which I would have hauled overland
to Willson's creek and from there to Indianola
by sail boat.</p>

<p>Our plans being laid we struck out for Indianola
to buy our goods&mdash;all kinds of articles that we
thought would catch the negro's eye, including a
good supply of tanglefoot&mdash;which I am sorry to say
cost me dear, besides being the cause of smashing
my little scheme into a thousand fragments.</p>

<p>We finally started back from Indianola with our
load of goods; and Jack being an irishman, couldn't
resist the temptation of taking a "wee drop of the
critter" every fifteen or twenty minutes. The consequences
were everything but edifying.</p>

<p>I hired Anthony Moore, a gentleman of color to
haul the Blood Hound and all of our traps to the
river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>We fixed rollers under the boat and after getting
her out high and dry on the ball prairie, found that
we didn't have oxen enough to carry out the job.</p>

<p>While Anthony Moore was off rustling for a couple
more yoke of cattle, I hired a horse to ride up to
the Post Office after my mail, but before starting
I gave Jack a raking over for remaining drunk so
long. He hadn't drawn a sober breath since leaving
town.</p>

<p>When I returned next evening Jack was gone&mdash;no
one there but my faithful dog, Ranger.</p>

<p>I found Jack had taken a negro's skiff and pulled
down Willson's creek, taking all of my snide jewelry,
tobacco, etc. along. I traced him up to where he
had sold a lot of the stuff. He sold an old englishman
a lot of tobacco for seven dollars that didn't
cost less than twenty. Being discouraged I sold
the Blood Hound to Anthony Moore for twenty-five
dollars, right where she lay, on the open prairie.</p>

<p>I then hired to Wiley Kuykendall, who was buying
and shipping beeves at Houston, at twenty-five
dollars per month. I left my companion, Ranger,
with Anthony, paying him two dollars and a half a
month for his board. But poor dog he met a sad
fate the next winter during one of my rash moments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>I was out after a wild bunch of horses one day
and while trying to slip up on them unobserved
Ranger and three others belonging to a neighbor
made a break after a little calf that jumped up out
of the tall grass, which of course scared the horses.
I wanted to run after them as that was my best and
only chance, but I hated to go off and let the dogs
kill the poor little calf which they all four had hold
of by that time.</p>

<p>I finally galloped back and yelled myself hoarse
trying to get them off; but no use, so drawing my
pistol I began firing right and left.</p>

<p>When the smoke cleared away I discovered two
of the dogs lifeless and poor Ranger crawling up
towards me howling with pain. He was shot through
both shoulders. No, no! I didn't feel bad; it was
some other youngster about my size. I dismounted
and caressed the poor dumb brute, with tears in
my eyes. It was ten miles to camp or the nearest
ranch, therefore I had no alternative but to kill
him&mdash;or leave him there to suffer and finally die.
I had tried to lift him on my horse so as to take
him to camp and try and doctor him up, but he was
too heavy&mdash;being a large, powerful brute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>I made several attempts to kill him, but every
time I would raise the pistol to shoot he would look
up into my eyes so pitifully as much as to say
please don't kill me. I at last mounted my horse
and after starting off wheeled around in my saddle
and put a bullet between his eyes. Thus ended the
life of as faithful a dog as ever lived.</p>

<p>After New Year's I quit Mr. Wiley and went to
work again on my own hook, skinning cattle and
branding Mavricks. I had bought me a twenty-five
dollar horse for the occasion.</p>

<p>I established my camp at the head of Cashe's
creek, three miles above Mr. Yeamans.' The only
company I had was Ranger and I didn't have him
but a short while, as you already know.</p>

<p>Cattle died pretty badly that winter and therefore
I made quite a pile of money, besides branding a
great many Mavricks.</p>

<p>About the middle of April I met with a painful and
almost fatal accident&mdash;got shot through the knee
with one of those old time dragoon pistols, which
carry a very large ball.</p>

<p>The bullet entered the top of my knee and came
out&mdash;or at least was cut out&mdash;on the opposite side;
went right through the knee-cap. The doctor who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
waited on me said I would be a cripple for life, but
he missed his guess, although I have received another
bullet hole through the same knee since then.</p>

<p>After getting wounded I remained at Mr. Yeamans'
awhile and then went down to Mr. Morris'
on Tresspalacious Bay to board.</p>

<p>When I got so that I could move around on
crutches I went up to Mr. John Pierce's ranch to
live. Mr. Pierce had persuaded me to put in my
time going to school while unable to work. He
gave me my board and washing free and all I had to
do was to take care of the "children," little Johnny
Pierce, eight years old, Mamie Pierce, "Shang's"
only child, twelve years old and a Miss Fannie
Elliott, sweet sixteen. The school house being two
miles off, we had to ride on horseback.</p>

<p>I would have had a soft time of it all summer,
but before two weeks rolled around I had a fuss
with the red complexioned school master. I then
mounted "Boney-part" and struck out for Houston,
ninety miles east.</p>

<p>I arrived in Houston during the State Fair.
Everything was lively there&mdash;in fact too lively for
me. The first thing I did was to strike a monte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
game and the second thing was lose nearly all the
money I had.</p>

<p>After quitting the monte game I struck out to
hunt aunt "Mary" whom I heard had moved to
Houston from Galveston. I had never seen her
that I remembered of, but held her in high esteem
for her kindness in sending me the white canvas
breeches during the war.</p>

<p>I found her after hunting all day; she kept a private
boarding house close to the Union depot.
She appeared to be glad to see me.</p>

<p>The next day aunt Mary's husband, Mr. James
McClain, took me out to the Fair ground to see
the sights. The biggest sight to me was Jeff. Davis,
although I was deceived as to his makeup; I expected
to see a portly looking man on a gray horse.</p>

<p>May be the following song that I used to sing
during the war had something to do with that, for
it ran thus:</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Jeff Davis is our President,<br />
And Lincoln is a fool,<br />
Jeff Davis rides a big gray horse<br />
While Lincoln rides a mule.<br />

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIII" id="Chapter_XIII"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">MOTHER AND I MEET AT LAST.</p>

<p>After spending a week with aunt Mary, I grew
restless and pulled for Galveston to visit my
uncle "Nick." I went by way of steamboat down
Buffalo bayou, leaving my horse and saddle in
Houston.</p>

<p>I landed in the "Island City" one evening about
dark. The first man I met, I inquired of him, if
he knew where Mr. Nicholas White lived? "Why
of course," was his quick answer, "I have known
him for seventeen years." He then gave me the
directions how to find him.</p>

<p>His wife, whom he had just married a short while
before, she being his second wife, met me at the
door and escorted me to the bed room where I
found the old fellow three sheets in the wind. He
soon braced up though and tendered me a hearty
welcome.</p>

<p>The next day he spent in showing me around the
city and introducing me to his friends as his little
nephew who had to "skip" from western Texas for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
stealing cattle. I remember there were several high
toned officials among the ones he introduced me to;
one of them I think was Tom Ochiltree&mdash;a red-headed
Congressman or Senator, I forget which.</p>

<p>The old gentleman had a horse and buggy, consequently
I had a regular picnic, during my stay,
driving up and down the beach watching the pretty
girls go in bathing.</p>

<p>I remained there two weeks and on taking my
departure uncle "Nick" presented me with a Spencer
Carbine&mdash;one he had captured from a yankee
while out scouting during the war. I was very
proud of the gift for I had never owned a repeating
rifle before.</p>

<p>I landed in Houston flat broke, but wasn't long
in making a raise of ten dollars from aunt Mary.
Boney-part had been taken good care of during my
absence, which made him feel too rollicky&mdash;he tried
to pitch me off when I got on him.</p>

<p>After bidding aunt Mary and uncle "Jim" good-bye
I struck out for Allen, Pool &amp; Co.'s ranch on
Simms' bayou. There I hired to a Mr. Joe Davis of
Clear creek, who had the contract furnishing beef
to the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe R. R. which
was just building out from Galveston.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>About the first of September I mounted Ranger,
a pony I swapped Boney-part for and lit out for
Tresspalacious. My wound by that time was about
well.</p>

<p>On arriving at Mr. "Tom" Kuykendall's at the
head of Tresspalacious river, I learned that mother
was at Mr. Morris', at the mouth of Cashe's creek,
waiting for me. She had arrived there just a few
days after my departure&mdash;for parts unknown, as
no one knew where I was going.</p>

<p>You see after getting shot I wrote to mother
telling her of the accident and also sending her
some money, as I was in the habit of doing when
flush. Hence, like a kind mother, she came out to
be of service to me, but arrived too late.</p>

<p>It is needless to say we were glad to meet, for
the first time in several long years.</p>

<p>I went right to work trying to rig up a home for
her. She had brought some money with her and I
sold a lot of Mavricks&mdash;some of those I branded the
winter previous&mdash;for two dollars a head, therefore
we both together had money enough to build and
furnish a shanty.</p>

<p>As Mr. Morris was just going to Indianola in his
schooner we sent by him after our lumber, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
But before he got there the "big" storm, which swept
nearly every soul from the Peninsula and nearly
wiped Indianola out of existence, struck him and
scattered his boat, money and everything he had
aboard to the four winds of Heaven. He and his
son "Tom" barely escaped with their own lives.</p>

<p>Mother and I experienced a share of the same
storm too; we were still at Mr. Morris.' The storm
came about ten o'clock at night and blew the Morris
mansion down, leaving us, Mrs. Morris, her
three children and a step-son, "Jim," mother and
myself to paddle around in water up to our waists
until morning.</p>

<p>When daylight came the Bay shore was lined
with dead cattle just as far as the eye could reach;
cattle that had blown into the water and drowned.</p>

<p>When Mr. Morris got back he started a new
ranch up at the head of Cashe's creek, where I had
camped the winter before and I built mother a
shanty a few hundred yards from his, so she
wouldn't get lonesome while I was away.</p>

<p>I built it out of an old torn down house that I
bought from Mr. John Pierce on "tick" for I was
then financially "busted."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Cattle didn't die very badly that coming winter,
therefore I did not make much money. But towards
spring I got my work in branding Mavricks.
Some days I would brand as high as fifteen or
twenty head.</p>

<p>That spring there was a law passed prohibiting
the carrying of pistols and I was the first man to
break the law, for which they socked a heavier fine
to me than I was able to pay; but I found a good
friend in the person of Mr. John Pierce who loaned
me the desired amount without asking for it.</p>

<p>The first of April I hired to W. B. Grimes to go
"up the trail" at thirty dollars per month. I bade
mother good bye, promising to return, sure, that
coming fall.</p>

<p>Our outfit consisted of twenty-five hundred head
of old mossy-horn steers, a cook and twenty-five
riders, including the boss, Asa Dawdy, with six
head of good horses to the man.</p>

<p>Everything went on lovely with the exception of
swimming swollen streams, fighting now and then
among ourselves and a stampede every stormy night,
until we arrived on the Canadian river in the Indian
territory; there we had a little indian scare. When
within a few miles of the river, Dawdy went on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
ahead to look up a good crossing; it wasn't long
until we discovered a terrible dust on the trail between
us and the river; it looked like it might be a
cyclone coming, but instead of that it was our boss
returning. He galloped up almost out of wind
telling us to stop the herd and make preparations
for war, as the woods along the river were covered
with indians on the war path.</p>

<p>After getting everything in shape for war, he
selected two of his best armed men, which happened
to be Otto Draub and myself, to go back with
him and try to make peace with the red devils. We
scoured the woods out thoroughly, but only succeeded
in finding one old, blind "buck." Asa had,
no doubt, seen him and imagined the rest. From
that time on though we were among indians all the
time; and they used to try and scare Asa into giving
them "wo-ha's," (cattle) but he wasn't one of the
scaring kind&mdash;except when taken by surprise.</p>

<p>Everything went on smoothly again until we arrived
at "Salt Fork" close to the Kansas line. It
was raining and storming terribly when we hove in
sight of the above named river. Asa went on
ahead with the wagons&mdash;we having an extra one
along then to haul wood and water in&mdash;to find a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
crossing, but on arriving there he found it very
high, almost swimming; he succeeded in getting
both wagons over though. He then galloped back
to hurry the herd up.</p>

<p>We were just about a mile from the river when
he came dashing up saying: "Whoop 'em up boys!
for she's rising a foot every second."</p>

<p>When we got there she was "bank full" and still
rising. It was at least half a mile to the opposite
side and drift wood was coming down at a terrible
rate, which made it dangerous to cross. But the
wagons being over made it a ground hog case&mdash;or
at least we thought so.</p>

<p>The old lead steers went right into the foaming
water without a bit of trouble and of course the
balance followed.</p>

<p>Henry Coats was in the lead of the herd, Asa
Dawdy and Otto Draub on the left point, while
negro "Gabe" and I kept them from turning to the
right.</p>

<p>We were all&mdash;that is we fellows on the points&mdash;out
in swimming water when Henry Coats' horse
went under, which scared the leaders, causing the
whole herd to turn back amidst terrible confusion.
Coats came very near drowning. We worked for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
half an hour or more trying to get the herd to take
water again, but failed. The river continued to rise
until she was over a mile wide.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, we remained there seven days
without anything to eat except fresh meat without
salt. It rained during the whole time nearly, so
that we didn't get much sleep on account of having
to stay with the cattle night and day.</p>

<p>The first grub we got was from a lot of soldiers
camped on the opposite side of the wicked little
stream "Wild Horse." They were waiting for it to
go down so they could proceed to Wichita, Kansas,
their destination.</p>

<p>The boss, Dawdy, a fellow by the name of
Hastings and myself found the "blue coats" while
out hunting a lot of steers lost the night before during
a severe storm. We had spied the white tents
off to the southward and pulled out for them, in
a gallop.</p>

<p>On arriving within a few hundred yards we found
out that a swift stream of muddy water laid
between us.</p>

<p>They were camped right on the opposite bank
from where we stood. Dawdy yelled over asking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
if they could spare some chuck? "Yes" was the
quick response, "If you will come over after it."</p>

<p>Dawdy and Hastings both looked at me, as much
as to say: "Charlie it all depends on you." I was
considered an extra good swimmer.</p>

<p>After shedding my heaviest clothes&mdash;there being
officers' wives in camp, so that I couldn't undress
altogether&mdash;I put spurs to "Yankee-doodle" and
went into her. It was at least two hundred yards
across, but I made it all O. K.</p>

<p>When the captain found out how long we had
been without grub he ordered the cook to bring out
some cold biscuits. He brought out a large pan
full, and after I got my fists full, a lot of the soldiers
took the balance and selecting a narrow place,
threw them over one by one to Dawdy and Hastings.</p>

<p>After hiding a dozen or two fat Government biscuits
under my belt, I began studying up a plan by
which I could get some flour and salt, also coffee,
over. At last I hit upon a plan: I got a wash-tub
from the captain's wife and filling it full of such
stuff as we needed, launched her out into the water;
I swam by the side of it and landed on the opposite
side about half a mile below where I started
in at. I then took the tub back thanked our benefactors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
mounted Yankee-doodle and pulled for the
other shore feeling a thousand per cent. better.</p>

<p>We arrived at camp about sundown and the boys
went to work baking bread by rolling the dough
around a stick and holding it over the fire. Some
of them sat up all night eating, trying to make up
for lost time.</p>

<p>The sun came out next morning for the first time
in eight long days and towards evening we made it
across the river. The wagons we found at the "Pond
Creek" ranch on the Kansas line. The cooks had
been having a soft time.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIV" id="Chapter_XIV"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">ON A TARE IN WICHITA, KANSAS.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of July, after being on the
trail just three months, we landed on the "Ninnasquaw"
river, thirty miles west of Wichita, Kansas.</p>

<p>Nearly all the boys, the boss included, struck out
for Wichita right away to take the train for Houston,
Texas, the nearest railroad point to their
respective homes. Mr. Grimes paid their railroad
fares according to custom in those days. I concluded
I would remain until fall.</p>

<p>Mr. Grimes had come around by rail, consequently
he was on hand to receive us. He already had several
thousand steers&mdash;besides our herd&mdash;on hand;
some that he drove up the year before and others he
bought around there. He had them divided up into
several different herds&mdash;about eight hundred to the
herd&mdash;and scattered out into different places, that
is each camp off by itself, from five to ten miles
from any other. With each herd or bunch would be
a cook and "chuck" wagon, four riders, a "boss"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
included&mdash;and five horses to the rider. During the
day two men would "herd" or watch the cattle until
noon and the other two until time to "bed" them,
which would be about dark. By "bedding" we
mean take them to camp, to a certain high piece of
ground suitable for a "bed ground" where they
would all lie down until morning, unless disturbed
by a storm or otherwise. The nights would be divided
up into four equal parts&mdash;one man "on" at a
time, unless storming, tormented with mosquitos or
something of the kind, when every one except the
cook would have to be "out" singing to them.</p>

<p>The herd I came up the trail with was split into
three bunches and I was put with one of them under
a man by the name of Phillups, but shortly
afterwards changed and put with a Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>I spent all my extra time when not on duty,
visiting a couple of New York damsels, who lived
with their parents five miles east of our camp. They
were the only young ladies in the neighborhood,
the country being very thinly settled then, therefore
the boys thought I was very "cheeky"&mdash;getting on
courting terms with them so quick. One of them
finally "put a head on me"&mdash;or in grammatical
words, gave me a black eye&mdash;which chopped my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
visits short off; she didn't understand the Texas
way of proposing for one's hand in marriage, was
what caused the fracas. She was cleaning roasting-ears
for dinner when I asked her how she would
like to jump into double harness and trot through
life with me? The air was full of flying roasting-ears
for a few seconds&mdash;one of them striking me
over the left eye&mdash;and shortly afterwards a young
Cow Puncher rode into camp with one eye in a
sling. You can imagine the boys giving it to me
about monkeying with civilized girls, etc.</p>

<p>After that I became very lonesome; had nothing
to think of but my little Texas girl&mdash;the only one
on earth I loved. While sitting "on herd" in the hot
sun, or lounging around camp in the shade of the
wagon&mdash;there being no trees in that country to supply
us with shade&mdash;my mind would be on nothing
but her. I finally concluded to write to her and find
out just how I stood. As often as I had been with her
I had never let her know my thoughts. She being
only fourteen years of age, I thought there was
plenty time. I wrote a long letter explaining everything
and then waited patiently for an answer. I
felt sure she would give me encouragement, if nothing
more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>A month passed by and still no answer. Can it
be possible that she don't think enough of me to
answer my letter? thought I. "No," I would finally
decide, "she is too much of an angel to be guilty
of such."</p>

<p>At last the supply wagon arrived from Wichita
and among the mail was a letter for me. I was on
herd that forenoon and when the other boys came
out to relieve Collier and I, they told me about
there being a letter in camp for me, written by a female,
judging from the fine hand-writing on the
envelope.</p>

<p>I was happy until I opened the letter and read a
few lines. It then dropped from my fingers and I
turned deathly pale. Mr. Collier wanted to know
if some of my relations wasn't dead? Suffice it to
say that the object of my heart was married to my
old playmate Billy Williams. The letter went on to
state that she had given her love to another and
that she never thought I loved her only as a friend,
etc. She furthermore went on advising me to grin
and bear it, as there were just as good fish in the
sea as ever was caught etc.</p>

<p>I wanted some one to kill me, so concluded to
go to the Black hills&mdash;as everyone was flocking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
there then. Mr. Collier, the same man I traded
the crippled horse to&mdash;agreed to go with me. So
we both struck out for Wichita to settle up with
daddy Grimes. Mr. Collier had a good horse of
his own and so did I; mine was a California pony
that I had given fifty-five dollars for quite awhile
before. My intention was to take him home and
make a race horse of him; he was only three years
old and according to my views a "lightning striker."</p>

<p>After settling up, we, like other "locoed" Cow
Punchers proceeded to take in the town, and the
result was, after two or three days carousing around,
we left there "busted" with the exception of a few
dollars.</p>

<p>As we didn't have money enough to take us to
the Black hills, we concluded to pull for the Medicine
river, one hundred miles west.</p>

<p>We arrived in Kiowa, a little one-horse town on
the Medicine, about dark one cold and disagreeable
evening.</p>

<p>We put up at the Davis House, which was kept
by a man named Davis&mdash;by the way one of the
whitest men that ever wore shoes. Collier made
arrangements that night with Mr. Davis to board<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
us on "tick" until we could get work. But I wouldn't
agree to that.</p>

<p>The next morning after paying my night's lodging
I had just one dollar left and I gave that to
Mr. Collier as I bade him adieu. I then headed
southwest across the hills, not having any destination
in view; I wanted to go somewhere but didn't
care where. To tell the truth I was still somewhat
rattled over my recent bad luck.</p>

<p>That night I lay out in the brush by myself and
next morning changed my course to southeast,
down a creek called Driftwood. About noon I accidently
landed in Gus Johnson's Cow camp at the
forks of Driftwood and "Little Mule" creeks.</p>

<p>I remained there all night and next morning when
I was fixing to pull out&mdash;God only knows where,
the boss, Bill Hudson, asked me if I wouldn't stay
and work in his place until he went to Hutchison,
Kansas and back? I agreed to do so finally if he
would furnish "Whisky-peat," my pony, all the corn
he could eat&mdash;over and above my wages, which were
to be twenty-five dollars a month. The outfit consisted
of only about twenty-five hundred Texas
steers, a chuck wagon, cook and five riders besides
the boss.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after Mr. Hudson left we experienced
a terrible severe snow storm. We had to stay with
the drifting herd night and day, therefore it went
rough with us&mdash;myself especially, being from a
warm climate and only clad in common garments,
while the other boys were fixed for winter.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hudson came back from Hutchison
he pulled up stakes and drifted south down into the
Indian territory&mdash;our camp was then on the territory
and Kansas line&mdash;in search of good winter
quarters.</p>

<p>We located on the "Eagle Chief" river, a place
where cattle had never been held before. Cattlemen
in that section of country considered it better
policy to hug the Kansas line on account of indians.</p>

<p>About the time we became settled in our new
quarters, my month was up and Mr. Hudson paid
me twenty-five dollars, telling me to make that my
home all winter if I wished.</p>

<p>My "pile" now amounted to forty-five dollars,
having won twenty dollars from one of the boys,
Ike Berry, on a horse race. They had a race horse
in camp called "Gray-dog," who had never been
beaten, so they said, but I and Whisky-peat done
him up, to the extent of twenty dollars, in fine shape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>I made up my mind that I would build me a "dug-out"
somewhere close to the Johnson camp and put
in the winter hunting and trapping. Therefore as
Hudson was going to Kiowa, with the wagon, after
a load of provisions, etc., I went along to lay me
in a supply also.</p>

<p>On arriving at Kiowa I found that my old "pard"
Mr. Collier had struck a job with a cattleman whose
ranch was close to town. But before spring he left
for good "Hold Hengland" where a large pile of
money was awaiting him; one of his rich relations
had died and willed him everything he had. We
suppose he is now putting on lots of "agony," if
not dead, and telling his green countrymen of his
hair-breadth escapes on the wild Texas plains.</p>

<p>We often wonder if he forgets to tell of his experience
with "old gray," the pony I traded to him
for the boat.</p>

<p>After sending mother twenty dollars by registered
mail and laying in a supply of corn, provisions,
ammunition, etc., I pulled back to Eagle Chief, to
make war with wild animals&mdash;especially those that
their hides would bring me in some money, such as
gray wolves, coyotes, wild cats, buffaloes and bears.
I left Kiowa with just three dollars in money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning after arriving in camp I took
my stuff and moved down the river about a mile
to where I had already selected a spot for my winter
quarters.</p>

<p>I worked like a turk all day long building me a
house out of dry poles&mdash;covered with grass. In
the north end I built a "sod" chimney and in the
south end, left an opening for a door. When finished
it lacked about two feet of being high enough
for me to stand up straight.</p>

<p>It was almost dark and snowing terribly when I
got it finished and a fire burning in the low, Jim
Crow fire-place. I then fed Whisky-peat some corn
and stepped out a few yards after an armful of good
solid wood for morning. On getting about half an
armful of wood gathered I heard something crackling
and looking over my shoulder discovered my
mansion in flames. I got there in time to save
nearly everything in the shape of bedding, etc.
Some of the grub, being next to the fire-place, was
lost. I slept at Johnson's camp that night.</p>

<p>The next morning I went about two miles down
the river and located another camp. This time I
built a dug-out right on the bank of the stream, in
a thick bunch of timber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>I made the dug-out in a curious shape; started in
at the edge of the steep bank and dug a place six
feet long, three deep and three wide, leaving the
end next to the creek open for a door. I then commenced
at the further end and dug another place
same size in an opposite direction, which formed an
"L." I then dug still another place, same size,
straight out from the river which made the whole
concern almost in the shape of a "Z." In the end
furthest from the stream I made a fire-place by
digging the earth away&mdash;in the shape of a regular
fire-place. And then to make a chimney I dug a
round hole, with the aid of a butcher knife, straight
up as far as I could reach; then commencing at the
top and connecting the two holes. The next thing
was to make it "draw," and I did that by cutting
and piling sods of dirt around the hole, until about
two feet above the level.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to build a roof over my 3 &times; 18
mansion. To do that I cut green poles four feet
long and laid them across the top, two or three
inches apart. Then a layer of grass and finally, to
finish it off, a foot of solid earth. She was then
ready for business. My idea in making it so
crooked was, to keep the indians, should any happen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
along at night, from seeing my fire. After
getting established in my new quarters I put out
quite a number of wolf baits and next morning
in going to look at them found several dead wolves
besides scores of skunks, etc. But they were frozen
too stiff to skin, therefore I left them until a warmer
day.</p>

<p>The next morning on crawling out to feed my
horse I discovered it snowing terribly, accompanied
with a piercing cold norther. I crawled back into
my hole after making Whisky-peat as comfortable
as possible and remained there until late in the evening,
when suddenly disturbed by a horny visitor.</p>

<p>It was three or four o'clock in the evening, while
humped up before a blazing fire, thinking of days
gone by, that all at once, before I had time to
think, a large red steer came tumbling down head
first, just missing me by a few inches. In traveling
ahead of the storm the whole Johnson herd had
passed right over me, but luckily only one broke
through.</p>

<p>Talk about your ticklish places! That was truly
one of them; a steer jammed in between me and
daylight, and a hot fire roasting me by inches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>I tried to get up through the roof&mdash;it being only
a foot above my head&mdash;but failed. Finally the old
steer made a terrible struggle, just about the time
I was fixing to turn my wicked soul over to the
Lord, and I got a glimpse of daylight under his
flanks. I made a dive for it and by tight squeezing
I saved my life.</p>

<p>After getting out and shaking myself I made a
vow that I would leave that God-forsaken country
in less than twenty-four hours; and I did so.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XV" id="Chapter_XV"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XV.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A LONELY TRIP DOWN THE CIMERON.</p>

<p>The next morning after the steer racket I pulled
out for Kiowa, Kansas. It was then sleeting
from the north, consequently I had to face it.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the evening I changed my
notion and concluded to head for Texas. So I
turned east, down the Eagle Chief, to where it
emptied into the Cimeron, and thence down that
stream; knowing that I was bound to strike the
Chisholm trail&mdash;the one I came up on, the spring
before.</p>

<p>I camped that night at the mouth of Eagle Chief,
and went to roost on an empty stomach, not having
brought any grub with me. I was then in the western
edge of what is known as the Black-jack country,
which extends east far beyond the Chisholm
trail.</p>

<p>The next morning I continued down the Cimeron,
through Black-jack timber and sand hills.
To avoid the sand hills, which appeared fewer on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the opposite side, I undertook to cross the river,
but bogged down in the quicksand and had to turn
back.</p>

<p>That night I camped between two large sand
hills and made my bed in a tall bunch of blue-stem
grass. I went to bed as full as a tick, as I had just
eaten a mule-eared rabbit, one I had slipped up
onto and killed with a club. I was afraid to shoot
at the large droves of deer and turkeys, on account
of the country being full of fresh indian signs.</p>

<p>I crawled out of my nest next morning almost
frozen. I built a roaring big fire on the <i>south</i> edge
of the bunch of tall grass so as to check the cold
piercing norther. After enjoying the warm fire a few
moments, I began to get thirsty and there being no
water near at hand, I took my tin cup and walked
over to a large snow-drift a short distance off, to
get it full of clean snow, which I intended melting
by the fire to quench my burning thirst.</p>

<p>While filling the cup I heard a crackling noise
behind me and looking over my shoulder discovered
a blaze of fire twenty feet in the air and spreading at
a terrible rate. I arrived on the scene just in time
to save Whisky-peat from a horrible death. He
was tied to a tree, the top limbs of which were already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in a blaze. I also managed to save my saddle
and an old piece of saddle blanket, they being out
under the tree that Whisky-peat was tied to. I
didn't mind losing my leather leggins, saddle blankets,
etc., so much as I did the old delapidated
overcoat that contained a little silver-plated match
box in one of the pockets.</p>

<p>That day I traveled steady, but not making very
rapid progress, on account of winding around sand
hills, watching for indians and going around the
heads of boggy sloughs. I was certain of striking
the Chisholm trail before night, but was doomed to
disappointment.</p>

<p>I pitched camp about nine o'clock that night and
played a single-handed game of freeze-out until
morning, not having any matches to make a fire
with.</p>

<p>I hadn't gone more than two miles next morning
when I came across a camp-fire, which looked as
though it had been used a few hours before; on
examination I found it had been an indian camp,
just vacated that morning. The trail, which contained
the tracks of forty or fifty head of horses,
led down the river. After warming myself I struck
right out on their trail, being very cautious not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
run onto them. Every now and then I would dismount
and crawl to the top of a tall sand hill to see
that the road was clear ahead.</p>

<p>About noon I came to a large creek, which proved
to be "Turkey Creek." The reds had made a good
crossing by digging the banks down and breaking
the ice.</p>

<p>After crossing, I hadn't gone but a short distance
when I came in sight of the Chisholm trail. I never
was so glad to see anything before&mdash;unless it was
the little streak of daylight under the steer's flanks.</p>

<p>The indians on striking the trail had struck south
on it; and after crossing the Cimeron I came in sight
of them, about five miles ahead of me. I rode
slow so as to let them get out of sight. I didn't
care to come in contact with them for fear they
might want my horse and possibly my scalp.</p>

<p>About dark that evening I rode into a large camp
of Government freighters, who informed me that
the fifty indians who had just passed&mdash;being on
their way back to the reservation&mdash;were Kiowas
who had been on a hunting expedition.</p>

<p>I fared well that night, got a good supper and a
warm bed to sleep in&mdash;besides a good square meal
of corn and oats for my horse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning before starting on my journey,
an old irish teamster by the name of "Long Mike"
presented me with a pair of pants&mdash;mine being almost
in rags&mdash;and a blue soldier coat, which I can
assure you I appreciated very much.</p>

<p>About dusk that evening, I rode into Cheyenne
Agency and that night slept in a house for the first
time since leaving Kiowa&mdash;in fact I hadn't seen a
house since leaving Kiowa.</p>

<p>The next morning I continued south and that
night put up at "Bill" Williams' ranch on the "South
Canadian" river.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving the Williams ranch next
morning I met a crowd of Chickasaw indians who
bantered me for a horse race. As Whisky-peat
was tired and foot-sore, I refused; but they kept
after me until finally I took them up. I put up my
saddle and pistol against one of their ponies. The
pistol I kept buckled around me for fear they might
try to swindle me. The saddle I put up and rode
the race bare-back. I came out ahead, but not
enough to brag about. They gave up the pony
without a murmer, but tried to persuade me to run
against one of their other ponies, a much larger
and finer looking one. I rode off thanking them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
very kindly for what they had already done for me.</p>

<p>That night I put up at a ranch on the Washita
river and next morning before leaving swapped my
indian pony off for another one and got ten dollars
to-boot.</p>

<p>That morning I left the Chisholm trail and struck
down the Washita river, in search of a good, lively
place where I might put in the balance of the winter.</p>

<p>I landed in Erin Springs late that evening and
found a grand ball in full bloom at Frank Murry's
mansion. The dancers were a mixed crowd, the
ladies being half-breeds and the men, mostly americans
and very tough citizens.</p>

<p>Of course I joined the mob, being in search of
excitement and had a gay old time drinking kill-me-quick
whisky and swinging the pretty indian maidens.</p>

<p>After breakfast next morning the whole crowd,
ladies and all, went down the river five miles to
witness a "big" horse race at "Kickapoo" flat.</p>

<p>After the "big" race&mdash;which was for several thousand
dollars&mdash;was over the day was spent in running
pony races and drinking whisky. By night the
whole mob were gloriously drunk, your humble servant
included. There were several fights and fusses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
took place during the day, but no one seriously
hurt.</p>

<p>It being against the laws of the United States
to sell, or have whisky in the Indian territory, you
might wonder where it came from: A man by the
name of Bill Anderson&mdash;said to have been one of
Quantrell's men during the war&mdash;did the selling.</p>

<p>He defied the United States marshalls and it was
said that he had over a hundred indictments against
him. He sold it at ten dollars a gallon, therefore
you see he could afford to run quite a risk.</p>

<p>The next day on my way down the river to
Paul's valley I got rid of my extra pony; I came
across two apple peddlers who were on their way to
Fort Sill with a load of apples and who had had the
misfortune of losing one of their horses by death,
the night before, thereby leaving them on the
prairie helpless, unable to move on. They had no
money to buy another horse with, having spent all
their surplus wealth in Arkansas for the load of
apples. When I gave them the pony, they felt
very happy judging from their actions. On taking
my departure one of them insisted on my taking his
silver watch as a token of friendship. I afterwards
had the watch stolen from me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, patient reader, I will now drop the curtain
for awhile. Just suffice it to say I had a tough time
of it during the rest of the winter and came out
carrying two bullet wounds. But I had some gay
times as well as tough and won considerable money
running Whisky-peat.</p>

<p>The following May I landed in Gainesville, Texas,
"right side up with care" and from there went to
Saint Joe on the Chisholm trail, where I succeeded
in getting a job with a passing herd belonging to
Capt. Littlefield of Gonzales. The boss' name was
"Jim" Wells and the herd contained thirty-five
hundred head of stock cattle. It being a terribly
wet season we experienced considerable hardships,
swimming swollen streams, etc. We also had some
trouble with indians.</p>

<p>We arrived in Dodge City, Kansas on the third
day of July and that night I quit and went to town
to "whoop 'em up Liza Jane."</p>

<p>I met an old friend that night by the name of
"Wess" Adams and we both had a gay time, until
towards morning when he got severely stabbed in a
free-to-all fight.</p>

<p>On the morning of July fifth I hired to David T.
Beals&mdash;or the firm of Bates &amp; Beals, as the outfit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was commonly called&mdash;to help drive a herd of steers,
twenty-five hundred head, to the Panhandle of
Texas, where he intended starting a new ranch.</p>

<p>The next morning we struck out on the "Old Fort
Bascom" trail, in a southwesterly direction.</p>

<p>The outfit consisted of eight men besides the
boss, Bill Allen and "Deacon" Bates, one of Mr.
Beals' silent partners, who was going along to locate
the new range and O. M. Johnson, the whole-souled
ex-rebel cook. We had six extra good
horses apiece, my six being named as follows:
Comanche, Allisan, Last Chance, Creeping Moses,
Damfido and Beat-and-be-damned. The last named
was afterwards shot full of arrows because he
wouldn't hurry while being driven off by a band of
indians who had made a raid on the camp.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVI" id="Chapter_XVI"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">MY FIRST EXPERIENCE ROPING A
BUFFALO.</p>

<p>About the sixth day out from Dodge we crossed
the Cimeron and that evening I had a little
excitement chasing a herd of buffaloes.</p>

<p>After crossing the river about noon, we drove
out to the divide, five or six miles and made a "dry"
camp. It was my evening to lay in camp, or do
anything else I wished. Therefore concluded I
would saddle my little indian mare&mdash;one I had
traded for from an indian&mdash;and take a hunt.</p>

<p>About the time I was nearly ready to go Mr.
Bates, seeing some of the cattle slipping off into a
bunch of sand hills which were near the herd, asked
me if I wouldn't ride out and turn them back. I
went, leaving my pistol and gun in camp, thinking
of course that I would be back in a few minutes.
But instead of that I didn't get back until after dinner
the next day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as I was starting back to camp, after turning
the cattle, a large herd of buffaloes dashed by camp
headed west. The boys all ran out with their guns
and began firing. I became excited and putting
spurs to my pony, struck out to overtake and kill
a few of them, forgetting that I didn't have anything
to shoot with. As they had over a mile the start it
wasn't an easy matter to overtake them. It was
about four o'clock in the afternoon and terribly hot;
which of course cut off my pony's wind and checked
her speed to a great extent.</p>

<p>About sundown I overtook them. Their tongues
were sticking out a yard. I took down my rope
from the saddle-horn, having just missed my shooting
irons a few minutes before, and threw it onto
a yearling heifer. When the rope tightened the
yearling began to bleat and its mammy broke back
out of the herd and took after me. I tried to turn
the rope loose so as to get out of the way, but
couldn't, as it was drawn very tight around the saddle-horn.
To my great delight, after raking some
of the surplus hair from my pony's hind quarters,
she turned and struck out after the still fleeing herd.</p>

<p>Now the question arose in my mind, "how are
you going to kill your buffalo?" Break her neck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was the only way I could think of; after trying it
several times by running "against" the rope at full
speed, I gave it up as a failure. I then concluded
to cut the rope and let her go, so getting out my
old frog-sticker&mdash;an old pocket knife I had picked
up a few days before and which I used to clean my
pipe&mdash;I went to work trying to open the little blade
it being the only one that would cut hot butter.
The big blade was open when I found it, consequently
it was nothing but a sheet of rust. The
little blade had become rusted considerably, which
made it hard to open. Previous to that I always
used my bowie knife, which at that time was hanging
to my pistol belt, in camp, to open it with.
After working a few minutes I gave up the notion
of opening the little blade and went to work sawing
at the rope with the big one. But I soon gave
that up also, as I could have made just as much
headway by cutting with my finger. At last I dismounted
and went to him, or at least her, with
nothing but my muscle for a weapon.</p>

<p>I finally managed to get her down by getting one
hand fastened to her under jaw and the other hold
of one horn and then twisting her neck. As some
of you might wonder why I had so much trouble with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
this little animal, when it is a known fact that one
man by himself can tie down the largest domestic
bull that ever lived, I will say that the difference
between a buffalo and a domestic bull is, that the
latter when you throw him hard against the ground
two or three times, will lie still long enough to give
you a chance to jump aboard of him, while the
former will raise to his feet, instantly, just as long
as there's a bit of life left.</p>

<p>After getting her tied down with my "sash," a
silk concern that I kept my breeches up with, I
went to work opening the little blade of my knife.
I broke the big one off and then used it for a pry to
open the other with.</p>

<p>When I got her throat cut I concluded it a good
idea to take the hide along, to show the boys that I
didn't have my run for nothing, so went to work
skinning, which I found to be a tedious job with
such a small knife-blade.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark when I started towards camp
with the hide and a small chunk of meat tied behind
my saddle.</p>

<p>After riding east about a mile, I abandoned the
idea of going to camp and turned south facing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
cool breeze in hopes of finding water, my pony and
I both being nearly dead for a drink.</p>

<p>It was at least twenty miles to camp over a level,
dry plain, therefore I imagined it an impossibility
to go that distance without water. As the streams
all lay east and west in that country, I knew by
going south I was bound to strike one sooner or
later.</p>

<p>About midnight I began to get sleepy, so, pulling
the bridle off my pony so she could graze, I spread
the buffalo hide down, hair up, and after wrapping
the end of the rope, that my pony was fastened to
around my body once or twice so she couldn't get
loose without me knowing it, fell asleep.</p>

<p>I hadn't slept long when I awoke, covered from
head to foot with ants. The fresh hide had attracted
them.</p>

<p>After freeing myself of most of the little pests
I continued my journey in search of water.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the morning I lay down
again, but this time left the hide on my saddle.</p>

<p>I think I must have been asleep about an hour
when all at once my pony gave a tremendous
snort and struck out at full speed, dragging me
after her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>You see I had wrapped the rope around my body
as before and it held me fast some way or another;
I suppose by getting tangled. Luckily for me
though it came loose after dragging me about a
hundred yards.</p>

<p>You can imagine my feelings on gaining my feet,
and finding myself standing on the broad prairie
afoot. I felt just like a little boy does when he lets
a bird slip out of his hand accidently&mdash;that is&mdash;exceedingly
foolish.</p>

<p>The earth was still shaking and I could hear a
roaring noise like that of distant thunder. A large
herd of buffaloes had just passed.</p>

<p>While standing scratching my head a faint noise
greeted my ear; it was my pony snorting. A tramp
of about three hundred yards brought me to her.
She was shaking as though she had a chill. I
mounted and continued my journey south, determined
on not stopping any more that night.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock next morning I struck water
on the head of Sharp's creek, a tributary to
"Beaver" or head of North Canadian.</p>

<p>When I got to camp&mdash;it having been moved south
about twenty miles from where I left it&mdash;the boys
had just eaten dinner and two of them were fixing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to go back and hunt me up, thinking some sad
misfortune had befallen me.</p>

<p>When we got to Blue Creek, a tributary to South
Canadian, camp was located for awhile, until a
suitable location could be found for a permanent
ranch.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates struck out across the country to the Canadian
river, taking me along, to hunt the range&mdash;one
large enough for at least fifty thousand cattle.</p>

<p>After being out three days we landed in Tascosa,
a little mexican town on the Canadian. There were
only two americans there, Howard &amp; Reinheart,
who kept the only store in town. Their stock of
goods consisted of three barrels of whisky and half
a dozen boxes of soda crackers.</p>

<p>From there we went down the river twenty-five
miles where we found a little trading point, consisting
of one store and two mexican families. The
store, which was kept by a man named Pitcher,
had nothing in it but whisky and tobacco. His customers
were mostly transient buffalo hunters, they
being mostly indians and mexicans. He also made
a business of dealing in robes, furs, etc., which he
shipped to Fort Lyons, Colorado, where his partner,
an officer in the United States Army lived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
There were three hundred Apache indians camped
right across the river from "Cold Springs," as
Pitcher called his ranch.</p>

<p>A few miles below where the little store stood
Mr. Bates decided on being the center of the
"L. X." range; and right there, Wheeler post-office
now stands. And that same range, which was then
black with buffaloes, is now stocked with seventy-five
thousand fine blooded cattle, and all fenced in.
So you see time makes changes, even out here in
the "western wilds."</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">AN EXCITING TRIP AFTER THIEVES.</p>

<p>After arriving on our newly located ranch we
counted the cattle and found the herd three
hundred head short.</p>

<p>Bill Allen, the boss, struck back to try and find
their trail. He found it leading south from the
"rifle pits." The cattle had stolen out of the herd
without anyone finding it out; and of course finding
themselves free, they having come from southern
Texas, they headed south across the Plains.</p>

<p>Allen came back to camp and taking me and two
horses apiece, struck down the river to head them
off. We made our headquarters at Fort Elliott and
scoured the country out for a hundred miles square.</p>

<p>We succeeded in getting about two hundred head
of them; some had become wild and were mixed
up with large herds of buffalo, while others had
been taken up by ranchmen around the Fort and
the brands disfigured. We got back to camp after
being absent a month.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>About the first of October four more herds arrived;
three from Dodge and one from Grenada,
Colorado, where Bates &amp; Beals formerly had a large
ranch. We then turned them all loose on the river
and established "Sign" camps around the entire
range, which was about forty miles square. The
camps were stationed from twenty-five to thirty
miles apart. There were two men to the camp and
their duty was to see that no cattle drifted outside
of the line&mdash;on their "ride," which was half way to
the next camp on each side, or in plainer words
one man would ride south towards the camp in that
direction, while his pard would go north until he
met the man from the next camp, which would
generally be on a hill, as near half way as possible.
If any cattle had crossed over the line during the
night they would leave a trail of course, and this
the rider would follow up until he overtook them.
He would then bring them back inside of the
line; sometimes though they would come out so
thick that half a dozen men couldn't keep them
back, for instance, during a bad storm. Under
such circumstances he would have to do the best he
could until he got a chance to send to the "home
ranch" for help.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>A young man by the name of John Robinson
and myself were put in a Sign camp ten miles south
of the river, at the foot of the Staked Plains. It
was the worst camp in the whole business, for three
different reasons, the first one being, cattle naturally
want to drift south in the winter, and secondly, the
cold storms always came from the north, and the
third and most objectionable cause was, if any happened
to get over the line onto the Staked plains
during a bad snow storm they were considered gone,
as there were no "breaks" or anything to check
them for quite a distance. For instance, drifting
southwest they would have nothing but a level plain
to travel over for a distance of three hundred miles
to the Pecos river near the old Mexico line.</p>

<p>John and I built a small stone house on the head
of "Bonetta" Canyon and had a hog killing time all
by ourselves. Hunting was our delight at first,
until it became old. We always had four or five
different kinds of meat in camp. Buffalo meat was
way below par with us, for we could go a few hundred
yards from camp any time of day and kill any
number of the woolly brutes. To give you an idea
how thick buffaloes were around there that fall will
say, at one time when we first located our camp on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the Bonetta, there was a solid string of them, from
one to three miles wide, going south, which took
three days and nights to cross the Canadian river.
And at other times I have seen them so thick on
the plains that the country would look black just as
far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>Late that fall we had a change in bosses. Mr.
Allen went home to Corpus Christi, Texas, and a
man by the name of Moore came down from Colorado
and took his place.</p>

<p>About Christmas we had a little excitement, chasing
some mexican thieves, who robbed Mr. Pitcher
of everything he had in his little Jim Crow store.
John and I were absent from our camp, six days on
this trip. There were nine of us in the persuing
party, headed by Mr. Moore, our boss. We caught
the outfit, which consisted of five men, all well
armed and three women, two of them being pretty
maidens, on the staked plains, headed for Mexico.
It was on this trip that I swore off getting drunk,
and I have stuck to it&mdash;with the exception of once
and that was over the election of President Cleveland&mdash;It
happened thus:</p>

<p>We rode into Tascosa about an hour after dark,
having been in the saddle and on a hot trail all day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
without food or water. Supper being ordered we
passed off the time waiting, by sampling Howard
and Reinheart's bug juice.</p>

<p>Supper was called and the boys all rushed to the
table&mdash;a few sheepskins spread on the dirt floor.
When about through they missed one of their
crowd&mdash;a fellow about my size. On searching far
and near he was found lying helplessly drunk under
his horse, Whisky-peet&mdash;who was tied to a rack in
front of the store. A few glasses of salty water
administered by Mr. Moore brought me to my right
mind. Moore then after advising me to remain
until morning, not being able to endure an all night
ride as he thought, called, "come on, fellers!" And
mounting their tired horses they dashed off at almost
full speed.</p>

<p>There I stood leaning against the rack not feeling
able to move. Whisky-peet was rearing and prancing
in his great anxiety to follow the crowd. I
finally climbed into the saddle, the pony still tied
to the rack. I had sense enough left to know that
I couldn't get on him if loose, in the fix I was in.
Then pulling out my bowie knife I cut the rope and
hugged the saddle-horn with both hands. I overtook
and stayed with the crowd all night, but if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
ever a mortal suffered it was me. My stomach felt
as though it was filled with scorpions, wild cats and
lizards. I swore if God would forgive me for geting
on that drunk I would never do so again. But
the promise was broken, as I stated before, when I
received the glorious news of Cleveland's election.</p>

<p>After New Year's, Moore took Jack Ryan, Vandozen
and myself and went on an exploring expedition
south, across the Staked plains, with a view
of learning the country.</p>

<p>The first place we struck was Canyon Paladuro,
head of Red river. The whole country over there
was full of indians and mexicans. We laid over two
days in one of their camps, watching them lance
buffaloes. From there we went to Mulberry where
we put in three or four days hunting. When we
pulled out again our pack-pony was loaded down
with fat bear meat.</p>

<hr class="r15" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="Chapter_XVIII" id="Chapter_XVIII"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XVIII.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">SEVEN WEEKS AMONG INDIANS.</p>

<p>On our arrival back to the ranch, Moore rigged
up a scouting outfit to do nothing but drift over
the Plains in search of strayed cattle.</p>

<p>The outfit consisted of a well-filled chuck-wagon,
a number one good cook, Mr. O. M. Johnson, and
three warriors, Jack Ryan, Vanduzen and myself.
We had two good horses apiece, that is, all but myself,
I had three counting Whisky-peet.</p>

<p>About the sixth day out we struck three thousand
Comanche Indians and became pretty badly scared
up. We had camped for the night on the plains,
at the forks of Mulberry and Canyon Paladuro; a
point from whence could be seen one of the roughest
and most picturesque scopes of country in the west.</p>

<p>The next morning Jack Ryan went with the
wagon to pilot it across Mulberry Canyon, while
"Van" and I branched off down into Canyon Paladuro
to look for cattle signs. We succeeded in
finding two little knotty-headed two-year old steers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
with a bunch of buffalo. They were almost as wild
as their woolly associates, but we managed to get
them cut out and headed in the direction the wagon
had gone.</p>

<p>About noon, on turning a sharp curve in the canyon,
we suddenly came in full view of our wagon
surrounded with a couple of thousand red skins, on
horse back, and others still pouring down from the
hills, on the east.</p>

<p>It was too late to figure on what to do, for they
had already seen us, only being about half a mile
off. You see the two wild steers had turned the
curve ahead of us and attracted the indians attention
in that direction. We couldn't see anything
but the white top of our wagon, on account of the
solid mass of reds, hence couldn't tell whether our
boys were still among the living or not. We thought
of running once, but finally concluded to go up and
take our medicine like little men, in case they were
on the war-path. Leaving Whisky-peet, who was
tied behind the wagon, kept me from running more
than anything else.</p>

<p>On pushing our way through the mass we found
the boys, winchesters in hand, telling the old chiefs
where to find plenty of buffalo. There were three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
thousand in the band, and they had just come from
Ft. Sill, Indian Territory, on a hunting expedition.
They wanted to get where buffaloes were plentiful
before locating winter quarters.</p>

<p>From that time on we were among indians all the
time. The Pawnee tribe was the next we came in
contact with. Close to the Indian Territory line we
run afoul of the whole Cheyenne tribe. They were
half starved, all the buffalo having drifted south, and
their ponies being too poor and weak to follow them
up. We traded them out of lots of blankets, trinkets,
etc. For a pint of flour or coffee they would give
their whole soul&mdash;and body thrown in for good
measure. We soon ran out of chuck too, having
swapped it all off to the hungry devils.</p>

<p>We then circled around by Ft. Elliott, and up the
Canadian river to the ranch, arriving there with
eighteen head of our steers, after an absence of seven
weeks.</p>

<p>We only got to remain at the ranch long enough
to get a new supply of chuck, etc., and a fresh lot
of horses, as Moore sent us right back to the Plains.
In a south westerly direction this time.</p>

<p>We remained on the Plains scouting around during
the rest of the winter, only making short trips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to the ranch after fresh horses and grub. We experienced
some tough times too, especially during
severe snow storms when our only fuel, "buffalo-chips,"
would be covered up in the deep snow.
Even after the snow melted off, for several days
afterwards, we couldn't get much warmth out of the
buffalo-chips, on account of them being wet.</p>

<p>About the first of April, Moore called us in from
the Plains to go up the river to Ft. Bascom, New
Mexico, on a rounding-up expedition. We were
gone on that trip over a month.</p>

<p>On our arrival back, Moore went right to work
gathering up everything on the range in the shape
of cattle, so as to "close-herd" them during the
summer. His idea in doing that was to keep them
tame. During the winter they had become almost
beyond control. The range was too large for so
few cattle. And another thing buffalo being so
plentiful had a tendency to making them wild.</p>

<p>About the first of June Moore put me in charge
of an outfit, which consisted of twenty-five hundred
steers, a wagon and cook, four riders, and five horses
to the man or rider. He told me to drift over the
Plains wherever I felt like, just so I brought the
cattle in fat by the time cold weather set in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>It being an unusually wet summer the scores of
basins, or "dry lakes," as we called them, contained
an abundance of nice fresh water, therefore we
would make a fresh camp every few days. The
grass was also fine, being mostly buffalo-grass and
nearly a foot high. If ever I enjoyed life it was
that summer. No flies or mosquitoes to bother, lots
of game and a palmy atmosphere.</p>

<p>Towards the latter part of July about ten thousand
head of "through" cattle arrived from southern
Texas. To keep the "wintered" ones from catching
the "Texas fever," Mr. Moore put them all on the
Plains, leaving the new arrivals on the north side of
the river. There was three herds besides mine.
And I was put in charge of the whole outfit, that is,
the four herds; although they were held separate as
before, with the regular number of men, horses, etc.
to each herd.</p>

<p>I then put one of my men in charge of the herd
I had been holding, and from that time on until late
in the fall I had nothing to do but ride from one
herd to the other and see how they were getting
along. Some times the camps would be twenty
miles apart. I generally counted each bunch once
a week, to be certain they were all there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>About the first of October, Moore came out and
picked eight hundred of the fattest steers out of the
four herds and sent them to Dodge to be shipped to
Chicago. He then took everything to the river, to
be turned loose onto the winter range until the next
spring.</p>

<p>When the hardest work was over&mdash;winter camps
established, etc., I secured Moore's consent to let
me try and overtake the shipping steers, and
accompany them to Chicago. So mounted on
Whisky-peet I struck out, accompanied by one of
the boys, John Farris. It was doubtful whether we
would overtake the herd before being shipped, as
they had already been on the road about fifteen
days, long enough to have gotten there.</p>

<p>The night after crossing the Cimeron river we
had a little indian scare. About three o'clock that
afternoon we noticed two or three hundred mounted
reds, off to one side of the road, marching up a
ravine in single file. Being only a mile off, John
proposed to me that we go over and tackle them for
something to eat. We were terribly hungry, as well
as thirsty.</p>

<p>I agreed, so we turned and rode towards them.
On discovering us they all bunched up, as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
parleying. We didn't like such maneuvering, being
afraid maybe they were on the war-path, so turned
and continued our journey along the road, keeping
a close watch behind for fear they might conclude
to follow us.</p>

<p>We arrived on Crooked Creek, where there was
a store and several ranches, just about dark. On
riding up to the store, where we intended stopping
all night, we found it vacated, and everything turned
up-side down as though the occupants had just left
in a terrible hurry. Hearing some ox bells down
the creek we turned in that direction, in hopes of
finding something to eat.</p>

<p>About a mile's ride brought us to a ranch where
several yoke of oxen stood grazing, near the door.
Finding a sack of corn in a wagon we fed our horses
and then burst open the door of the log house,
which was locked. Out jumped a little playful
puppy, who had been asleep, his master having
locked him up in there, no doubt, in his anxiety to
pull for Dodge.</p>

<p>Hanging over the still warm ashes was a pot of
nice beef soup which had never been touched. And
in the old box cupboard was a lot of cold biscuits and
a jar of nice preserves, besides a jug of molasses, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>After filling up we struck out for Dodge, still a
distance of twenty-five miles. We arrived there
a short while after sun-up next morning; and the
first man we met&mdash;an old friend by the name of
Willingham&mdash;informed us of the indian outbreak.
There had been several men killed on Crooked
Creek the evening before&mdash;hence John and I finding
the ranches deserted.</p>

<p>On riding through the streets that morning,
crowds of women, some of them crying, seeing we
were just in from the South, flocked around us inquiring
for their absent ones, fathers, brothers,
lovers and sons, some of whom had already been
killed, no doubt; there having been hundreds of
men killed in the past few days.</p>

<p>John and I of course laughed in our boots to
think that we turned back, instead of going on to
the band of blood-thirsty devils that we had started
to go to.</p>

<p>The first thing after putting our horses up at the
livery stable, we went to Wright &amp; Beverly's store
and deposited our "wealth." John had a draft for
one hundred and fourteen dollars, while I had about
three hundred and fifty dollars. We then shed our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
old clothes and crawled into a bran new rig out and
out. Erskine Clement, one of Mr. Beal's partners,
was in town waiting to ship the herd which should
have been there by that time. But he hadn't heard
a word from it, since getting Moore's letter&mdash;which,
by the way, had to go around through Las Vegas,
New Mexico, and down through the southern part
of Colorado&mdash;stating about what time it would
arrive in Dodge. He was terribly worried when I
informed him that John and I had neither seen nor
heard anything of the outfit since it left the ranch.</p>

<p>That night about ten o'clock John, who had struck
a lot of his old chums, came and borrowed twenty-five
dollars from me, having already spent his one
hundred and fourteen dollars that he had when he
struck town.</p>

<p>I went to bed early that night, as I had promised
to go with Clement early next morning to make a
search for the missing herd.</p>

<p>The next morning when Clement and I were fixing
to strike out, John came to me, looking bad
after his all night rampage, to get his horse and
saddle out of "soak." I done so, which cost me
thirty-five dollars, and never seen the poor boy
afterwards. Shortly after that he went to Ft. Sumner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and was killed by one of "Billy the Kid's"
men, a fellow by the name of Barney Mason. Thus
ended the life of a good man who, like scores of
others, let the greatest curse ever known to mankind,
whisky, get the upper hand of him.</p>

<p>Clement and I pulled south, our ponies loaded
down with ammunition so in case the indians got us
corralled we could stand them off a few days, at
least. We were well armed, both having a good
winchester and a couple of colts' pistols apiece.</p>

<p>We found the outfit coming down Crooked Creek;
they having left the main trail, or road, on the Cimeron,
and came over a much longer route, to avoid
driving over a dry stretch of country, forty miles
between water. Hence John and I missing them.
No doubt but that it was a lucky move in them taking
that route, for, on the other, they would have
just about come in contact with the three or four
hundred Cheyenne reds, whose bloody deeds are
still remembered in that country.</p>

<p>On arriving in town with the herd we split it in
two, making four hundred head in each bunch, and
put one half on the cars to be shipped to Chicago.
I accompanied the first lot, while Clement remained
to come on with the next.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>In Burlington, Iowa, I met Mr. Beals. We lay
there all day feeding and watering the cattle.</p>

<p>On arriving in Chicago, I went right to the Palmer
house, but after paying one dollar for dinner I
concluded its price too high for a common clod-hopper
like myself. So I moved to the Ervin
House, close to the Washington Street tunnel, a
two dollar a day house.</p>

<p>That night I turned myself loose taking in the
town, or at least a little corner of it. I squandered
about fifteen dollars that night on boot-blacks alone.
Every one of the little imps I met struck me for a
dime, or something to eat. They knew, at a glance,
from the cut of my jib, that they had struck a bonanza.
They continued to "work" me too, during
my whole stay in the city. At one time, while
walking with Mr. Beals and another gentleman, a
crowd of them who had spied me from across the
street, yelled "Yonder goes our Texas Ranger!
Lets tackle him for some stuff!"</p>

<p>About the third day I went broke, and from that
time on I had to borrow from Mr. Beals. I left
there about a hundred dollars in his debt.</p>

<p>After spending six days in the city I left for
Dodge City, Kansas, in company with Mr. Beals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and Erskine Clement, who, instead of stopping at
Dodge, continued on to Grenada, Colorado, where
the "Beals Cattle Co." still held their headquarters.</p>

<p>Arriving in Dodge City, I found Whiskey-peet,
whom I had left in Anderson's stable, all O. K., and
mounting him I struck out all alone for the "L. X."
ranch, two hundred and twenty-five miles.</p>

<p>Arriving at the ranch I found the noted "Billy
the Kid" and his gang there. Among his daring
followers were the afterwards noted Tom O'Phalliard,
and Henry Brown, leader of the Medicine Lodge
Bank tragedy which happened in 1884, who was
shot in trying to escape, while his three companions
were hung. "The Kid" was there trying to dispose
of a herd of ponies he had stolen from the
"Seven River warriors" in Lincoln County, New
Mexico&mdash;his bitter enemies whom he had fought so
hard against, that past summer, in what is known
as the "bloody Lincoln County war of '78." During
his stay at the ranch and around Tascosa, I became
intimately acquainted with him and his jovial crowd.
I mention these facts because I intend to give you
a brief sketch of Billy's doings, in the closing pages
of this book.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A LONELY RIDE OF ELEVEN HUNDRED MILES.</p>

<p>After laying around the ranch a couple of weeks,
Mr. Moore put me in charge of a scouting
outfit and sent me out on the South Plains to drift
about all winter, watching for cattle thieves, etc.; also
to turn back any cattle that might slip by the "sign
riders" and drift across the Plains.</p>

<p>During that winter we, that is my crowd, went
to church several times. A little Colony of Christians
headed by the Rev. Cahart, had settled on the
head of Salt Fork, a tributary of Red river, and
built a church house in which the little crowd, numbering
less than fifty souls would congregate every
Sunday and pray.</p>

<p>That same little church house now ornaments the
thriving little city of Clarendon, County seat of
Donley County. The old inhabitants point to it
with pride when telling of how it once stood solitary
and alone out on the great buffalo range two
hundred miles from nowhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The Colony had come from Illinois and drifted
away out there beyond the outskirts of civilization to
get loose from that demon whisky. And early
that coming spring a lot of ruffians started a saloon
in their midst. A meeting was called in the little
church house and resolutions passed to drive them
out, if in no other way, with powder and lead. They
pulled their freight and I am proud to state that I
had a hand in making them pull it; for the simple
reason that they had no business encroaching upon
those good people's rights.</p>

<p>When spring opened Mr. Moore called me in
from the Plains and put me in charge of a rounding-up
outfit, which consisted of twelve riders and a
cook.</p>

<p>To begin rounding-up, we went over to Canyon
Paladuro, where Chas. Goodnight had a ranch, and
where a great many of the river cattle had drifted
during the winter. There was about a hundred
men and seven or eight wagons in the outfit that
went over. We stopped over Sunday in the little
Christian Colony and went to church. The Rev.
Cahart preached about the wild and woolly Cow
Boy of the west; how the eastern people had him
pictured off as a kind of animal with horns, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
While to him, looking down from his dry goods
box pulpit into the manly faces of nearly a hundred
of them, they looked just like human beings, minus
the standing collar, etc.</p>

<p>About the first of July, Moore sent me to Nickerson,
Kansas, with a herd of eight hundred shipping
steers. My outfit consisted of five men, a chuck
wagon, etc. Our route lay over a wild strip of
country where there was no trails nor scarcely any
ranches&mdash;that is, until reaching the southern line of
Kansas.</p>

<p>We arrived at Nickerson after being on the road
two months. "Deacon" Bates, Mr. Beals partner,
was there waiting for us. He had come through
with several herds that had left the ranch a month
ahead of us. He was still holding some of the
poorest ones, south of town, where he had a camp
established.</p>

<p>After loading my wagon with a fresh supply of
grub, Mr. Bates, or the "Deacon" as he was more
commonly called, sent me back over the trail he
and his outfits had come, to gather lost steers&mdash;some
they had lost coming through.</p>

<p>I was gone about a month and came back with
eighteen head. We had a soft trip of it, as most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of our hard work was such as buying butter, eggs,
etc., from the scattering grangers along the Kansas
border. We never missed a meal on the trip, and
always had the best the country afforded, regardless
of cost. Deacon Bates was always bragging on
some of his bosses, how cheap they could live, etc.
I just thought I would try him this time, being in a
country where luxuries were plentiful, and see if he
wouldn't blow on me as being a person with good
horse sense. An animal of course, as we all know,
will eat the choicest grub he can get; and why not
man, when he is credited with having more sense
than the horse, one of the most intellectual animals
that exists?</p>

<p>On our return to Nickerson, I concluded to quit
and spend the winter with mother, whom I received
letters from every now and then begging me to
come home. As I wasn't certain of coming back,
I thought it best to go overland and take Whisky-peet
along, for I couldn't even bear the <i>thought</i> of
parting with him; and to hire a car to take him
around by rail would be too costly.</p>

<p>I got all ready to start and then went to Deacon
Bates for a settlement. He took my account book
and, after looking it over, said: "Why, Dum-it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
h&mdash;l, I can't pay no such bills as those! Why,
Dum-it all, old Jay Gould would groan under the
weight of these bills!" He then went on to read
some of the items aloud. They ran as follows:
Cod-fish $10; eggs $40; butter $70; milk $5; bacon
$150; flour $200; canned fruits $400; sundries
$600, etc., etc. Suffice it to say, the old gent told me
in plain Yankee English that I would have to go
to Chicago and settle with Mr. Beals. I hated the
idea of going to Chicago, for I knew my failings&mdash;I
was afraid I wouldn't have money enough left
when I got back to pay my expenses home.</p>

<p>That same evening a letter came from Mr. Beals
stating that he had just received a letter from Moore,
at the ranch, in which he informed him that there
were two more herds on the trail for Nickerson,
and, as it was getting so near winter, for Joe
Hargraves, better known as "Jinglebob Joe," and I
to go and turn them to Dodge City, the nearest
shipping point.</p>

<p>After putting Whisky-peet and my "Missouri"
mare, one I had bought to use as a pack-horse going
home, in care of an old granger to be fed and taken
good care of until my return, Joe and I struck out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
with only one horse apiece&mdash;just the ones we were
riding.</p>

<p>On our arrival in Dodge I pulled out for Chicago,
to get a settlement, with the first train load we
shipped. I took my saddle, bridle, spurs, etc.
along and left them in Atchison, Mo., the first point
we stopped to feed at, until my return.</p>

<p>Arriving in Chicago, I told Mr. Beals that I was
going home to spend the winter, and therefore
wanted to settle up.</p>

<p>He set 'em up to a fine Havana and then proceeded.
Every time he came to one of those big
bills, which caused the Deacon's eyes to bulge
out, he would grunt and crack about a forty-cent
smile, but never kicked.</p>

<p>When he had finished there was a few hundred
dollars to my credit. He then asked me if I could
think of anything else that I had forgotten to charge
the "company" with? Of course I couldn't, because
I didn't have time; his question was put to
me too sudden. If I could have had a few hours
to myself, to figure the thing up just right, I think
I could have satisfied the old Gent.</p>

<p>I remained in the city three days taking in the
sights and feeding the hungry little boot blacks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
When leaving, Mr. Beals informed me that he was
going to buy a lot of southern Texas cattle, to put
on his Panhandle ranch, the coming spring, and if
I wanted a job, to hold myself in readiness to boss
one of the herds up the trail for him. Of course
that just suited me, providing I couldn't make up
my mind to remain at home.</p>

<p>Landing in Nickerson I hired a horse and went
out to the old granger's ranch where I had left my
two ponies. They were both fat and feeling good.</p>

<p>Before starting out on my little journey of only
eleven hundred miles, I bought a pack-saddle and
cooking outfit&mdash;that is, just a frying pan, small coffee
pot, etc. I used the mare for a pack animal and
rode Whisky-peet. I had just six dollars left when
I rode out of Nickerson.</p>

<p>I went through Fort Reno and Fort Sill, Indian
territory and crossed Red river into Texas on the
old military road, opposite Henrietta.</p>

<p>When within ten miles of Denton, Texas, on
Pecan creek, Whisky-peet became lame&mdash;so much
so that he could scarcely walk. I was stopping
over night with a Mr. Cobb, and next morning I
first noticed his lameness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>I lacked about twenty-five cents of having enough
to pay Mr. Cobb for my night's lodging that morning.
I had sold my watch for five dollars a short
while before and now that was spent.</p>

<p>Whisky-peet being too lame to travel, I left him
with Mr. Cobb while I rode into Denton to try and
make a raise of some money.</p>

<p>I tried to swap my mare off for a smaller animal
and get some boot, but every one seemed to think
that she had been stolen; I being so anxious to
swap.</p>

<p>I rode back to Mr. Cobb's that night in the same
fix, financially, as when I left that morning.</p>

<p>The next day I made a raise of some money.
Mr. Cobb and I made a saddle swap, he giving
me twenty dollars to boot. He and I also swapped
bridles, I getting four dollars and a half to boot.
One of his little boys then gave me his saddle and
one dollar and a half for my pack-saddle, which
had cost me ten dollars in Nickerson. I then had
lots of money.</p>

<p>Whisky-peet soon got over his lameness, having
just stuck a little snag into the frog of his foot,
which I succeeded in finding and pulling out before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
it had time to do serious damage, and I started on
my journey again.</p>

<p>On arriving in Denton that time, a negro struck
me for a horse swap right away. I got a three
year old pony and six dollars in money for my mare;
the pony suited just as well for a pack animal as
the mare.</p>

<p>The next day after leaving Denton, I stopped in
a negro settlement and won a fifty-dollar horse,
running Whisky-peet against a sleepy looking grey.
I had up twenty dollars in money and my Winchester,
a fine silver mounted gun. I won the race
by at least ten open feet, but the negroes tried to
swindle me out of it.</p>

<p>While riding along that evening three negroes
rode up and claimed the horse I had won. They
claimed that the parties who bet him off had no
right to him, as they just had borrowed him from
one of them to ride to the Settlement that morning.
I finally let them have him for twenty dollars.</p>

<p>I went through the following towns after leaving
Denton: Ft. Worth, Clenborn, Hillsborough, Waco,
Herrene, Bryant, Brenham and Columbus; besides
scores of smaller places.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>I rode up to mother's little shanty on Cashe's
creek after being on the road just a month and
twelve days.</p>

<p>To say that mother was glad to see me would
only half express it. She bounced me the first
thing about not coming back the next fall after
leaving as I had promised. I had been gone nearly
four years.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">ANOTHER START UP THE CHISHOLM TRAIL.</p>

<p>I hadn't been at home but a few days when I came
very near getting killed by a falling house.</p>

<p>Mother had become tired of the neighborhood
she lived in and wanted me to move her and her
shanty down the creek about a mile, to Mr. Cornelius's.
So hiring a yoke of oxen&mdash;although a
pair of goats would have answered the purpose&mdash;I
hauled her household goods down to the spot selected.
I then went to work tearing the shanty
down.</p>

<p>In building it I had set eight pine posts two feet
in the ground, and then nailed the sidings, etc., to
them. There was only one room and it was eight
feet wide and fourteen long. The roof had been
made of heavy pine boards. After tearing both
ends out, I climbed onto the roof to undo that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>I was a-straddle of the sharp roof, about midway,
axe in one hand and a large chisel in the other,
when all at once the sides began spreading out at
the top. Of course I began sinking slowly but
surely, until everything went down with a crash.
The pine posts had become rotten from the top of
the ground down; and just as soon as the roof and
I had struck bottom the sides flopped over onto us.</p>

<p>A neighbor's little boy by the name of Benny
Williams, had been monkeying around watching me
work, and unluckily he was inside of the shanty
when the collapse came.</p>

<p>I was sensible, but unable to move, there being so
much weight on me.</p>

<p>Finally little Benny who was one thickness of
boards under me woke up and began squalling like
a six months old calf being put through the process
of branding.</p>

<p>After squalling himself hoarse he began to moan
most pitiously. That was too much for me. I
could stand his bleating but his moaning for help
put new life into my lazy muscles, causing me to
exert every nerve in my body, so as to get out and
render the poor boy assistance. I had, before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
boy's cries disturbed me, made up my mind to lie
still and wait for something to turn up.</p>

<p>In exerting myself I found that I could move my
body down towards my feet, an inch at a time. The
weight was all on my left shoulder. But it soon
came in contact with something else, which relieved
my bruised shoulder of most of the weight.</p>

<p>I got out finally after a long and painful struggle;
and securing help from the Morris ranch, fished
Benny out. He had one leg broken below the
knee, besides other bruises. I was slightly disfigured,
but still in the ring.</p>

<p>I put in the winter visiting friends, hunting, etc.
I had sold my cattle&mdash;the mavricks branded nearly
four years before&mdash;to Mr. Geo. Hamilton, at the
market price, from five to ten dollars a head, according
to quality, to be paid for when he got his
own brand put on to them. Every now and then
he would brand a few, and with the money received
for them I would buy grub and keep up my dignity.</p>

<p>About the first of March I received a letter from
Mr. Rosencrans, one of D. T. Beals' partners, stating
that Mr. Beals had bought his cattle in middle
Texas instead of southern as he had expected, and
as he had told me in Chicago. "But," continued the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
letter, "we have bought a herd from Charles Word
of Goliad, on the San Antonia River, to be delivered
at our Panhandle ranch and have secured you the
job of bossing it. Now should you wish to come
back and work for us, go out and report to Mr.
Word at once."</p>

<p>The next day I kissed mother good-bye, gave
Whisky peet a hug, patted Chief&mdash;a large white
dog that I had picked up in the Indian Territory on
my way through&mdash;a few farewell pats on the head,
mounted "Gotch"&mdash;a pony I had swapped my star-spangled
winchester for&mdash;and struck out for Goliad,
ninety miles west. Leaving Whisky-peet behind
was almost as severe on me as having sixteen jaw-teeth
pulled. I left him, in Horace Yeamans' care,
so that I could come back by rail the coming fall. I
failed to come back though that fall as I expected,
therefore never got to see the faithful animal again;
he died the following spring.</p>

<p>A three days' ride brought me to Goliad, the place
where Fannin and his brave followers met their sad
fate during the Mexican war. It was dark when I
arrived there. After putting up my horse, I learned
from the old gent Mr. Word, who was a saddler,
and whom I found at work in his shop, that his son<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Charlie was out at Beeville, gathering a bunch of
cattle.</p>

<p>Next morning I struck out for Beeville, thirty
miles west, arriving there about four o'clock in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>About sun-down I found Charles Word, and his
crowd of muddy cow-punchers, five miles west of
town. They were almost up to their ears in mud,
(it having been raining all day,) trying to finish "road
branding" that lot of steers before dark. The corral
having no "chute" the boys had to rope and
wrestle with the wild brutes until the hot iron could
be applied to their wet and muddy sides.</p>

<p>When I rode up to the corral, Charlie came out,
and I introduced myself. He shook my hand with
a look of astonishment on his brow, as much as to
say, I'll be&mdash;&mdash;if Beals mustn't be crazy, sending
this smooth-faced kid here to take charge of a herd
for me! He finally after talking awhile told me that
I would have to work under Mr. Stephens, until we
got ready to put up the Beals herd&mdash;or at least the
one I was to accompany. He also told me to keep
the boys from knowing that I was going to boss the
next herd, as several of them were fishing for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
job, and might become stubborn should they know
the truth.</p>

<p>I went on "night-guard" after supper and it continued
to rain all night, so that I failed to get any
sleep; but then I didn't mind it, as I was well
rested.</p>

<p>The next day after going to work, was when I
caught fits though, working in a muddy pen all day.
When night came I didn't feel as much like going
on guard as I did the night before. A laughable
circumstance happened that morning after going
into the branding-pen.</p>

<p>As the pen had no "chute" we had to rope and
tie down, while applying the brand. The men working
in pairs, one, which ever happened to get a good
chance, to catch the animal by both fore feet as he
run by which would "bump" him, that is, capsize
him. The other fellow would then be ready to
jump aboard and hold him until securely fastened.
There being only seven of us to do the roping that
morning, it of course left one man without a "pard,"
and that one was me. Each one you see is always
anxious to get a good roper for a "pard," as then
everything works smoothly. Mr. Word told me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
sit on the fence and rest until Ike Word, an old negro
who used to belong to the Word family, and who
was the best roper in the crowd, returned from town
where he had been sent with a message.</p>

<p>It wasn't long till old Ike galloped up, wearing a
broad grin. He was very anxious to get in the pen
and show "dem fellers de art of cotching um by
boaf front feet." But when his boss told him he
would have to take me for a "pard" his broad grin
vanished. Calling Mr. Word to one side he told
him that he didn't want that yankee for a "pard,"
as he would have to do all the work, etc. He was
told to try me one round and if I didn't suit he
could take some one else. Shortly afterwards while
passing Mr. Word old Ike whispered and said:
"Dogon me if dat yankee don't surprise de natives!"
When night came, and while I was on herd, old Ike
sat around the camp fire wondering to the other
boys "whar dat yankee learned to rope so well."
You see Mr. Word had told the boys that I was
from the Panhandle, and old Ike thought the Panhandle
was way up in Yankeedom somewhere,
hence he thinking I was a yankee. A few days
after that though, I satisfied old Ike that I was a
thoroughbred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Word bought a bunch of ponies, new arrivals
from Mexico, and among them was a large iron-grey,
which the mexicans had pointed out as being
"Muncho Deablo." None of the boys, not even old
Ike, cared to tackle him. So one morning I caught
and saddled him. He fought like a tiger while being
saddled; and after getting it securely fastened he
threw it off and stamped it into a hundred pieces,
with his front feet, which caused me to have to buy
a new one next day. I then borrowed Mr. Stephens'
saddle, and after getting securely seated in it, raised
the blinds and gave him the full benefit of spurs and
quirt. After pitching about half a mile, me, saddle
and all went up in the air, the girths having broken.
But having the "hackimore" rope fastened to my
belt I held to him until help arrived. I then borrowed
another saddle, and this time stayed with
him. From that on, old Ike recognized me as a
genuine cow-puncher.</p>

<p>We finally got that herd, of thirty-seven hundred
steers, ready for the trail; but the very night after
getting them counted and ready to turn over to Mr.
Stephens the next morning, they stampeded, half of
them getting away and mixing up with thousands of
other cattle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Stephens thought he would try a new scheme
that trip up the trail, so he bought a lot of new bulls-eye
lanterns to be used around the herd on dark,
stormy nights, so that each man could tell just where
the other was stationed by the reflection of his
light.</p>

<p>This night in question being very dark and stormy,
Stephens thought he would christen his new lamps.
He gave me one, although I protested against such
nonsense.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock some one suddenly flashed his
bulls-eye towards the herd, and off they went, as
though shot out of a gun.</p>

<p>In running my horse at full speed in trying to get
to the lead, or in front of them, me, horse, bulls-eye
and all went over an old rail fence&mdash;where there
had once been a ranch&mdash;in a pile. I put the entire
blame onto the lamp, the light of which had blinded
my horse so that he didn't see the fence.</p>

<p>I wasn't long in picking myself up and mounting
my horse who was standing close by, still trembling
from the shock he received. I left the lamp where
it lay, swearing vengeance against the use of them,
around cattle, and dashed off after the flying herd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>When daylight came I and a fellow by the name
of Glass, found ourselves with about half of the
herd, at least ten miles from camp. The rest of the
herd was scattered all over the country, badly mixed
up with other cattle. It took us several days to get
the lost ones gathered, and the herd in shape again.</p>

<p>After bidding Stephens and the boys who were
to accompany him, adieu, to meet again on Red
River where he was to wait for us, we pulled for
Goliad to rig up a new outfit, horses, wagon, etc.</p>

<p>The horses, Word bought out of a mexican herd
which had just arrived from Old Mexico. He gave
eighteen dollars a head for the choice, out of several
hundred head.</p>

<p>Being all ready to start for Kimble County, two
hundred miles northwest, where the herd was to be
gathered, Mr. Word turned the outfit over to me,
while he went around by stage.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A TRIP WHICH TERMINATED IN THE
CAPTURE OF "BILLY THE KID."</p>

<p>We went through San Antonio and lay there
long enough to have all of our horses shod,
as we were going into a mountainous country where
they couldn't stand it without shoes. While there
I visited the Almo building where poor Davy
Crocket and his brave companions bit the dust.</p>

<p>We arrived at our destination, Joe Taylor's ranch,
on Paint creek a small tributary to the Llano, at
last; and it was one of the roughest, rockiest, God-forsaken
countries I ever put foot on.</p>

<p>We finally, after three weeks hard work, got the
herd of twenty-five hundred head started towards
the north star. We were awful glad to get out of
there too, for our horses were all nearly peetered out,
and the men on the war-path, from having to work
twenty-six hours a day.</p>

<p>At Red river we overtook Stephens and changed
herds with him, his being the ones to go to Beal's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
ranch, while the others were for the Wyoming
market.</p>

<p>After parting with Stephens again we turned in
a northwesterly direction and arrived at the "L. X."
ranch on the first day of July.</p>

<p>Moore sent me right out on the Plains to hold the
herd I came up with, until fall. That just suited me
as I needed a rest.</p>

<p>After turning the herd loose on the range about
the first of September, I was put in charge of a
branding outfit. Our work then was drifting over
the range branding calves.</p>

<p>Late in the fall when all the branding was done,
Moore put me in charge of a scouting outfit and
sent me out on the Plains to drift around, the same
as previous winters.</p>

<p>I hadn't been there long, though, when he sent
word for me to turn my outfit over to James
McClaughety and come in to the ranch; and to bring
three of my picked men along.</p>

<p>On arriving at the ranch I found that he wanted
me to take an outfit and go to New Mexico after a
lot of cattle that "Billy the Kid" had stolen and run
over there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The cattlemen along the Canadian river had hired a
fellow by the name of Frank Stuart to keep a lookout
for stolen cattle in New Mexico; and along in the
summer he came to the Panhandle and notified the
different cattlemen who had him employed that
"Billy the Kid" and his gang were making a regular
business of stealing Panhandle cattle and selling
them to an old fellow named Pat Cohglin who had
a large ranch on Three rivers, close to Ft. Stanton.</p>

<p>The outfits then made up a crowd between them,
and sent with Stuart, giving him orders to go right
to the Cohglin ranch and take all the cattle found
there, in their brands.</p>

<p>But Mr. Stuart failed to go nearer than forty
miles from where the cattle were reported to be.
He claimed that Cohglin, who had a blood-thirsty
crowd around him, sent him word that if he got the
cattle he would have to take some hot lead with
them, or something to that effect. So Stuart came
back, claiming he didn't have men enough.</p>

<p>This made Moore mad, so he concluded to rig up
an outfit of his own and send them over after the
cattle, hence he sending out after me.</p>

<p>My outfit, after getting it rigged up, consisted of
a chuck wagon with four good mules to pull it, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
cook and five picked men, named as follows: James
East, Lee Hall, Lon Chambers, Cal Pope and last
but not by any means least "Big-foot Wallace."
They all, except me, had one extra good horse
apiece; I had two. Moore thought it best not to
have many horses to feed, as corn would be scarce
and high. He thought it best to buy more if we
needed them.</p>

<p>On starting, Moore gave me these orders: "Stay
over there until you get those cattle or bust the
"L. X." company. I will keep you supplied in
money just as long as they have got a nickel left,
that I can get hold of. And when you get the
cattle if you think you can succeed in capturing
"Billy the Kid" do so. You can hire all the men
you need; but don't undertake his capture until you
have first secured the cattle."</p>

<p>At Tascosa we met Stuart who had succeeded in
raising a little crowd to join us. Mr. McCarty,
boss of the "L. I. T." ranch had furnished five men,
a cook and chuck wagon; and Torry, whose ranch
was further up the river, a wagon and two men,
while a man by the name of Johnson furnished a
man and wagon. The "L. I. T." outfit was in charge
of a fellow by the name of "Bob" Roberson, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
orders were to get the stolen cattle before trying to
capture the Kid, but in the meantime, to be governed
by Stuart's orders. This placed "Bob" in bad
shape, as you will see later.</p>

<p>Stuart, after we all got strung out, took the "buck-board"
on the mail line, and went on ahead to Las
Vegas to put in a week or so with his solid girl.</p>

<p>On arriving at San Lorenzo, New Mexico, I
mounted a buck-board and struck out ahead, to Las
Vegas, to buy a lot of corn, grub, ammunition, etc.,
to be delivered at Anton Chico, twenty-five miles
south of "Vegas," by the time the crowd got there,
so as not to cause any delay. "Bob" Roberson also
gave me money to buy a lot of stuff for his outfit.</p>

<p>Arriving in Vegas, during a severe snow storm,
I found there wasn't fifty bushels of corn in town,
the snow storm having delayed the freight trains.
One merchant had just got a bill of several car loads
which he expected to arrive any minute. So I concluded
I would wait&mdash;and help Stuart hold the town
down.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter to Anton Chico, telling the boys
to lay there and take it easy, as I might be detained
several days waiting for corn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Every morning I would go to the grain merchant,
and receive this reply: "Am looking for it every
minute; t'will certainly be here by night."</p>

<p>Not being acquainted in town, time passed off
very slowly, so I finally got to "bucking" at my old
favorite game&mdash;monte. I won for a while, but finally
my luck took a turn and I lost nearly every dollar
I had in my possession, most of which belonged to
my employers. The one hundred dollars that "Bob"
Roberson gave to buy stuff for his outfit, also went.</p>

<p>While standing over the exciting game, after my
pile had dwindled down to an even seventy dollars,
I put just half of it, thirty-five dollars, on the
Queen, or "horse," as it is called, being the picture
of a woman on horseback, and made a vow, if I
lost that bet that I never would as long as I lived,
"buck" at monte again. I lost, and my vow has
been sacredly kept.</p>

<p>The corn finally arrived, but having no money,
I had to run my face by giving an order on the
"L. X." company, payable on demand. The other
stuff, ammunition, etc., also things "Bob" had sent
for, I had to buy in the same manner. Of course
I hated to give orders so soon after leaving the
ranch with a pocketfull of money, but then that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
was the best I could do under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>After getting the goods started for Anton Chico,
Stuart and I hired a rig and followed.</p>

<p>Arriving in "Chico" we found Barney Mason, (an
ex-chum of the "Kid's," but now a deputy sheriff
under Pat Garrett) there, with a message from Garrett
telling Stuart to meet him in Vegas at a certain
date, on important business. So Stuart struck right
back to Vegas, accompanied by Mason, as the date
fixed was only a few days off.</p>

<p>I found the boys all well and having a fat time.
The only thing that bothered me they had run in
debt head over heels on the strength of me having
lots of money. The merchants expected their pay
according to contract, immediately after my arrival.
I had to satisfy them with orders on the "L. X."
firm.</p>

<p>The boys had lots of news to relate, things that
had happened after I left: One of "Bob's" men
had had a shooting scrape with some mexicans; and
"Billy the Kid" and his crowd had been in town,
they having come in afoot, and went out well
mounted. He and his five men having hoofed it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
through deep snow from the Greathouse ranch, over
a hundred miles southwest of there.</p>

<p>After getting everything in shape we pulled out
for White Oaks, one hundred and fifty miles southwest.</p>

<p>The second night out we camped at the Lewelling
Wells, where bright and early next morning Stuart
overtook us; accompanied by Pat Garrett and Barney
Mason. They came with a scheme all cut and
dried, by which they could get the big reward
offered for the "Kid." Garrett knew the Kid and
his few remaining followers had been to Chico and
left for Fort Sumner a few days before; and that
they were wore out from having been chased all
over the country by a gang of ninety men from
White Oaks and vicinity. Now was his time to
strike, if he could just get Stuart to go in cahoots
with him. That was soon accomplished; a promise
of half of the reward, I suppose, done the work.
Hence he sending for Stuart to come and see him
in "Vegas" on important business.</p>

<p>After eating breakfast Stuart broke the ice by
telling a lie. He knew our orders were strictly to
get the cattle first, and then if we could assist in
the capture of the "Kid" to do so. Therefore he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
branched out thus: "Well boys, we have got a job
on our hands: 'Kid' is on his way to Old Mexico
with a bunch of Panhandle cattle; and we want
every man in the outfit, except just enough to accompany
the wagons to White Oaks, to go with Garrett
and I to overtake them."</p>

<p>"How can that be," someone asked "when Kid
and his men just left Anton Chico a few days ago?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," was the quick answer, unless some
of his outfit had the cattle under herd somewhere
down the river waiting for him. If you doubt my
word about it, just ask Mr. Garrett, there.</p>

<p>Of course we all did doubt his word, and were
well satisfied that it was a put up job, to gain the
reward.</p>

<p>"Bob" Roberson and I went to one side and
talked the matter over, while Stuart and his little
party remained at camp wondering whether their
little scheme would have strength to hold out, on
its weak legs or not.</p>

<p>"Bob" was in favor, after we had talked the thing
over, of going right back and telling Stuart in plain
English that he lied. But I wouldn't agree to that
for fear it might accidently be true. I thought it
strange that Garrett, who had the reputation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
being a model of a man, would sit by with his
mouth shut and listen to such a falsehood. Of course
Garrett couldn't be blamed very much for he, being
Sheriff, was interested in the "Kid's" capture, no
matter what became of the cattle we had come after.</p>

<p>"Bob" and I finally concluded, for fear the statement
might be true, to let them have a few men,
but not enough to completely cripple us so that we
couldn't go on after the cattle should we think it
best, after getting to White Oaks.</p>

<p>I let them take three out of my crowd: "Jim"
East, "Lon" Chambers and "Lee" Hall. While
"Bob" gave up two, "Tom" Emory and Louis Bozman.
Stuart wasn't satisfied, he wanted more. But
not being successful in getting his whole wants
supplied, they all rode off down the Pecos valley.</p>

<p>Shortly after they left we pulled out on the White
Oaks road. That night it began to snow, and kept
it up for several days until the whole ground was
covered to the depth of from two to three feet; so
that it was slow work getting our wagons along
through it.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards we came to the Greathouse
ranch, or at least to the hot ashes where it
once stood, where "Kid" and six of his daring followers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
were surrounded by ninety men one whole
night and day. It was as follows:</p>

<p>A squad of men left White Oaks to hunt the
"Kid" who was lurking in the neighborhood. They
suddenly came upon him and Bill Willson cooking
their breakfasts, one morning.</p>

<p>On discovering their enemies they both, after
firing a shot apiece, sped through the mountains
like deer, leaving their horses, saddles, coats and
breakfast behind.</p>

<p>One of the shots fired at the White Oaks party
took effect in the brain of a good horse that a young
man by the name of Johnny Hudgens was riding,
while the other, went through a hat, on the head of
a young man.</p>

<p>After following the trail through the deep snow
awhile, and after satisfying themselves that the two
young outlaws couldn't hide their tracks, the party
struck back to White Oaks after something to eat,
and more men.</p>

<p>When they returned, that same evening, there
was ninety men in the crowd. They got on the
trail and followed it, until shortly after dark, when
it brought them to within a few hundred yards of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the Greathouse ranch, on the "Vegas" and White
Oaks road.</p>

<p>To satisfy themselves that the game was bagged,
they circled around the ranch to see that no trails
were leading out from it.</p>

<p>They then stationed themselves in a circle around
the house and, dismounting, began to make breast-works
out of pine logs&mdash;the ranch being in the
midst of a large pine grove.</p>

<p>When day-light came Greathouse sent a negro,
who was stopping with him, out after the horses
which had been hobbled the night before.</p>

<p>Mr. "Nig" hadn't gone but a few hundred yards
when he was captured by the White Oaks boys.</p>

<p>After learning from him that the "Kid" and five
of his men were in the house they sent him back
with a note to the "Kid," telling him if he and his
party would come out with their hands up they
would be treated as prisoners of war; if not they
would have to stand the consequences, etc.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the negro returned with a note
from the "Kid," stating: "You fellers go to h&mdash;l!"
or something to that effect.</p>

<p>A consultation was then held, and finally decided
to give the boys one more chance for their lives,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
before storming the house. So they sent Mr. Coon
back with another note stating, that that would be
their last chance, etc.</p>

<p>In a short while a new messenger came forward.
It was "Jim" Greathouse, proprietor of the ranch.
He stated that the "Kid" desired to have a talk with
their leader. On asking him what assurance he
could give that their leader wouldn't be harmed, he
replied, "myself." He told them that they could
hold him a prisoner, and if anything happened to
Carlyle, he was willing to stand the consequences.</p>

<p>So Mr. "Jim" Carlyle, he being the leader,
marched forward&mdash;never more to return&mdash;to have
a talk with the "Kid".</p>

<p>Arriving in the house where there was also a
saloon, kept there to accommodate the thirsty traveler,
he was made to go up to the bar and drink
"health to Billy the Kid." This of course went
against the grain with "Jim," but then what else
could he do now, being at their mercy?</p>

<p>Finally the Kid spied one of the gloves he had
left behind in his retreat the day before, sticking
out of "Jim's" coat pocket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>This revived the hardships he and Billy Willson
were compelled to endure, nearly all day the day
before, traveling through snow up to their knees.
So pulling the glove out of "Jim's" pocket and holding
it up at arms length, he asked: "Jim, was you
with that mob yesterday who caused me such a
tramp through the snow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Well then, come up and take your last drink on
this earth, for I am going to blow your light out."</p>

<p>"Jim" of course didn't relish the half pint of rotgut
that he was forced to drink at the point of a
colts "45."</p>

<p>After drinking a full glass himself the "Kid"
threw his pistol down in "Jim's" face, full cocked,
telling him at the same time to say his prayers while
he slowly counted "three."</p>

<p>The "one, two, three!" was uttered, and then a
pistol shot rang out upon the still air, re-echoing
from the mountain sides, in every direction.</p>

<p>The bullet had struck its mark, a tin can hanging
on the wall a few inches above "Jim's" head.</p>

<p>"Well, Jim," was the first words that broke the
death-like silence within, "you are worth several
dead men yet, ain't you?" Said "Kid" grabbing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
"Jim's" trembling hand and leading him up to the
bar, over which Billy Willson handed the fiery bug-juice.</p>

<p>"You didn't think I would be brute enough to
shoot you in <i>such</i> a cowardly manner, did you, Jim?"
continued the "Kid" setting his empty glass down
on the counter.</p>

<p>The shot from within had excited the crowd outside
almost to fever heat; they thinking that it meant
their leaders' death. One fellow during the exciting
moment scribbled off a note which read thus: "If
Carlyle ain't out here in ten minutes by the watch,
your friend Greathouse will be a corpse," and sent it
to the "Kid" by the negro, who had returned after
delivering the last message which brought Greathouse
out.</p>

<p>The note was read in the presence of Carlyle, so
that he heard every word it contained.</p>

<p>"Kid" then answered it by stating: "Carlyle is
safe, but we can't give him up just yet. Now remember,
if we hear a shot from the outside we will
take it for granted that you have carried out your
threats by killing Greathouse, and will have to pay
you back by killing our prisoner," etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jim" knew the substance of the note and trembled
in his boots at the thoughts of an accident shot
being fired by his party. He was satisfied that his
men wouldn't do as they threatened in the note
after hearing, from the negro's own lips, that he
was still alive. It was the <i>accident</i> shot that disturbed
his mind.</p>

<p>The negro hadn't more than got behind the breastworks
with the note when a man, stationed behind
another breastwork, who knew nothing of the threat
having been made, fired a shot at the house "just
for fun."</p>

<p>Carlyle, on hearing the shot, made a leap at the
only glass window in the house, taking sash and all
with him. But before striking the ground several
bullets from the "Kids" well aimed "45" had pierced
his body. He crawled a few yards and then fell
over dead, in plain view of his eighty odd companions.</p>

<p>"Kid" claimed afterwards that he was sorry for having
had to kill "Jim." Their intentions were to hold
him prisoner until dark, when they would tie him
down, so he couldn't give the alarm, and then make
their escape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>From that on, the mad crowd outside kept up a
continued firing at the log house until dark. But
doing no damage, as the boys had breast-works
built of sacks of flour, boxes, bedding, etc.</p>

<p>Jim Greathouse during the excitement gave his
guards the slip and pulled for "tall timber" up in the
mountains where it was almost impossible for a
mounted man to follow. I have often afterwards
heard Greathouse laugh over the matter and tell
how he "just hit the high places," and beat Goldsmith
Maid's fastest time, for the first half mile.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock that night the White Oaker's
began to get tired and hungry, so concluded they
would go back to town, forty miles, fill up, get a
fresh mount and return by daylight, without the
"Kid" and his men knowing anything of it. They
stole off very slyly, without making any noise, and
when they got about a mile, put their horses down
to their best licks.</p>

<p>About midnight the little party inside made a
bold break for liberty. They headed north-east,
with cocked winchesters, determined on fighting
their way out. But they were happily disappointed.</p>

<p>A ten-mile tramp through snow brought them to
the Spencer ranch, which was kept by a kind old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
man by the name of Spencer, who lived there all
alone, and was trying to establish a shorter route
from "Vegas" to the "Oaks" by turning the road by
his place, where there was a fine spring of water, a
luxury the Greathouse ranch lacked, they having to
haul water a distance of several miles from up in
the rough mountains.</p>

<p>Just as day was breaking the crowd returned from
the "Oaks," and finding their game had fled they
set fire to the house and struck out on the newly
made foot prints.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Spencer ranch they learned, from
the old gentleman, that the "Kid" and his little party
of five had been gone about two hours, and that
they had eaten breakfast with him.</p>

<p>After continuing on the trail about an hour longer,
until it brought them to a rough strip of country where
they would be compelled to take it afoot, they gave
up the chase, and turned back to take their spite
out on poor old Spencer for feeding the "Kid" and
his crowd.</p>

<p>They took the poor old harmless fellow out to a
neighboring tree, after setting fire to his ranch, and
put a rope around his neck; but before they had
time to swing him up, a few of the men, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
been opposed from the start, interfered in the old
man's behalf. Thus his neck was saved, and he is
to-day a highly respected citizen in that community,
which has since that time become a rich mining
district.</p>

<p>The "Kid" and his men made it into Anton Chico,
where, as I stated before, they stole a good horse
and saddle apiece, while the boys were there waiting
for me to arrive from "Vegas," and pulled down
the Reo Pecos.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">BILLY THE KID'S CAPTURE</p>


<p>We arrived in the beautifully located town of
White Oaks on the 23d day of December,
(1880). The town, which consisted of 1000 inhabitants,
mostly American miners, was then not quite
two years old and pretty lively for its age. It contained
eight saloons; and Saturday nights when the
boys would come in from the surrounding mountains,
to spend the Sabbath, is when the little burg
would put on city airs.</p>

<p>We rented a large log house in the lower end of
town and went to living like white folks. We had
no money, but we struck two of the merchants who
gave us an unlimited credit until we could make a
raise. Our greatest expense was feeding the horses
corn which cost five cents a pound and hay, two
cents a pound. The grub we ate wasn't very expensive
as we stole all of our meat, and shared with
our honest neighbors who thought it a great sin to
kill other people's cattle. You see "Bob" and I still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
clung to the old Texas style which is, never kill one
of your own beeves when you can get somebody
else's.</p>

<p>We had concluded not to go after the stolen cattle
until the rest of the boys got there, by which
time the deep snow would be melted, maybe, so
that we could scour the White Mountains, where
the cattle were reported to be, out thoroughly.</p>

<p>New-Year's night we had a bushel of fun making
the citizens think that "Billy the Kid" had taken
the town. Billy was in the habit of "shooting the
town up a lot" every now and then, hence, every
time a few dozen shots were fired at an unusually late
hour, they putting it down as being some of his
devilment.</p>

<p>We first sent one of our crowd up-town to the
billiard hall, where most of the men generally congregated,
and especially "Pinto Tom," the marshal,
whose maneuvers we were anxious to learn, to watch
and see what kind of an effect our shooting had on
the people.</p>

<p>At precisely twelve o'clock we got out with winchesters
and six-shooters, cooks and all, and turned
ourselves loose. About one hundred shots were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fired in quick succession. We then went up town
to note the effect.</p>

<p>Arriving at the billiard hall we found old "Uncle
Jimmie," our man, standing in the door laughing fit
to kill himself. The hall was empty, with the exception
of a few who were still hid under tables,
chairs, etc. Most of them had gone out of the
back door, there being a rough canyon within a few
yards of it leading to the mountains, right at the
marshal's heels. It was said that "Pinto Tom"
didn't get in from the mountains for two days, and
when he did come, he swore he had been off prospecting.</p>

<p>Shortly after New-Years some of our men arrived,
bringing the news of the "Kid's" capture, while
the rest, Jim East and Tom Emory had accompanied
Garrett and Stuart to "Vegas" with the
prisoners.</p>

<p>Stuart sent a letter by one of the boys, stating
that he, East and Emory, would be in the "Oaks"
just as quick as they could get there, after turning
the prisoners over to the authorities in "Vegas."</p>

<p>So, knowing that we were destined to remain
around the "Oaks" a week or two at least, we pulled
out in the mountains and camped, so as to save expenses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
by letting our horses eat grass instead of
hay.</p>

<p>That night, after the boys arrived and after we
had moved camp out in the timber, while seated
around a blazing pinyon fire, Lon Chambers who
was a splendid single-handed talker, began relating
how they captured the "Kid," etc., which ran about
this way, as near as I can remember:</p>

<div class="blockquote5"><p>"After leaving you fellers we caught&mdash;&mdash;. It began
snowing that night, and kept it up for two or
three days and nights.</p>

<p>Arriving in Ft. Sumner, Garrett got word that
the Kid and outfit would be in town that night from
Los Potales, where the 'Kid's' ranch or cave was
situated, so he secured a house near the road leading
to 'Potales,' to secret his men in. He then kept
a man out doors, on guard, watching the road.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock that night, while we were all
inside playing a five-cent game of poker, the guard
opened the door and said, 'Garrett, here comes a
crowd down the road!' We all dashed out, winchesters
in hand, and hid behind an adobe fence,
close by, which they would be compelled to pass.</p>

<p>The moon was shining and we could tell who it
was, or at least Garrett and Mason could; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
being well acquainted with them. There was six
in the approaching crowd, and thirteen of us.</p>

<p>When they rode up within speaking distance
Garrett yelled, 'throw up your hands!' His voice
had hardly died out when thirteen shots from our
nervously gripped winchesters were fired into their
midst.</p>

<p>When the smoke cleared off we found that they
had all vanished, with the exception of Tom Ophalliard
who was mortally wounded, and died shortly
after. He had several bullet holes through his
body. 'These,' pointing down to his feet, 'are his
over shoes, and this' pulling off a finely finished
mexican sombraro and displaying it, "is the hat I
pulled from his head before he had quit kicking."</p>

<p>The next morning we struck out on the trail which
led back towards Los Potales. The white snow
along the trail was red with blood, having flowed
from the wounds in Rudabaugh's horse. The poor
animal died though after carrying his heavy master
through twelve miles of deep snow.</p>

<p>About midnight we hove in sight of a little rock
house standing on the banks of a small arroyo. The
trail led right up to the door which faced the south.
Right near the door stood four shivering horses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Knowing we had the little band trapped, we took
things cool until daylight, when we stationed ourselves
around the house.</p>

<p>There being no opening in the building except
the door, Garrett and Lee Hall crawled up to the end
wall so they could watch the door from around the
corner, while the rest of us concealed ourselves
behind knolls, etc.</p>

<p>We had left our horses behind a hill quite a distance
from the house.</p>

<p>When it became light enough to see, Charlie
Bowdre stepped out doors to see about his horse,
but he hadn't more than hit the ground when two
bullets, fired by Garrett and Hall, who were still at
the corner not a dozen feet from the door, sent him
to his long home. He only uttered a few words,
which were: 'I wish, I wish,' before his last breath
left him.</p>

<p>Of course that caused a stirring around inside;
they knew what it meant and began making preparations
for an escape. The 'Kid' had his pony
inside, out of the cold and the other four&mdash;Rudabaugh
having secured another one&mdash;were tied to
the door frame so that they could reach the ropes
without exposing their bodies. Now thought they if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
we can pull three of the horses inside we will mount
and make a bold dash out of the door. But when
they got the first animal about half way into the
house Garrett sent a bullet through its heart. The
dead animal of course blocked the way so that they
had to give up that scheme.</p>

<p>They then tried picking port holes through the
thick rock walls, but had to give it up also, as they
had nothing to do it with but their knives and firearms.</p>

<p>The 'Kid' and Garrett finally opened up a conversation.
The former seemed to be in fine humor.
Every now and then he would crack some kind of
a joke and then laugh, so that every one of us could
hear him. At one time he asked in a jovial way:
'Garrett, have you got a fire out there?' 'Yes, a
good one!' was the answer. 'Can we come out and
warm if we behave ourselves?' 'Yes,' replied
Garrett, 'but come with your hands up.' 'Oh, you
go to h&mdash;l, won't you? You old long-legged s&mdash;n
of a b&mdash;&mdash;h!'</p>

<p>You see they were without fire, water or provisions,
consequently we had the advantage. We
had a good fire out behind one of the knolls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
would take turns about, during the day and coming
night, going to warm.</p>

<p>They held out until next day, when they surrendered,
after being promised protection from mob
violence. Kid was the last man to come out with
his hands up. He said he would have starved to
death before surrendering if the rest had stayed
with him."</p></div>

<p>Chambers, after finishing gave a heavy sigh and
wondered whether Garrett and Stuart would act
white and whack up the reward evenly among the
whole outfit, or not.</p>

<p>"Bob" and I made arrangements with the boys to
loan us their part of the reward, which would
amount to considerable over a hundred dollars
apiece, until we got back to the ranch, to pay our
debts with.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A TRIP TO THE RIO GRANDE ON A MULE.</p>

<p>About the time we were getting out of patience
waiting, the two boys, East and Emory, arrived
with the good news that Stuart would be along
in a few days, he having to remain over to get their
part of the reward, etc.</p>

<p>Stuart arrived finally; he came in a buggy with a
gentleman from "Vegas." His orders to Roberson
and Torry's men were: "Boys, you fellows pull
right back to the ranch, as I have got some important
business to look after in 'Vegas.' We can come
back after those cattle in the spring," etc.</p>

<p>The boys who had helped capture the "Kid" and
outfit rounded him up for their part of the reward, but
he said it was already spent. Oh no, they wasn't mad!
Some of them swore that he would be a corpse before
morning. But luckily for him he pulled for
"Vegas" that night. I am not certain whether he was
aware of his danger or not, but there is one thing
I am certain of and that is, it wouldn't have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
healthy for him to remain in that locality very long.
"Bob" had even consented to the crowd hanging
him. I was the only one who protested, for the
simple reason that I do not believe in mob law. Of
course I thought it very wrong in swindling the
boys out of equal share of the reward, after they
had shared equally in the danger and hardships.</p>

<p>"Bob" was in a bad fix, in debt, no money and
ordered home, by one whose orders his boss had
told him to obey. The question was, how to stand
his creditors off and get grub, corn, etc. enough
to last him home.</p>

<p>I finally came to his rescue. As I intended remaining,
I went to the merchants and told them his
fix and guaranteed that he would send the money
he owed as soon as he got home, or else I would
let them take it out of my four mules and wagon,
which were worth a thousand dollars at least.</p>

<p>They let him off; also let him have grub, corn,
etc. enough to last him home, which would take
fifteen days to make the trip.</p>

<p>As some of my boys became homesick, on seeing
Roberson's outfit getting ready to pull back and as
I was anxious to cut down expenses, knowing that
I would have to lay there the rest of the winter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
waiting for money to pay up my bills before the
merchants would let me move my wagon, I let
three of them go along with "Bob." Those three
were James East, Cal. Pope and Lee Hall. "Bob"
let Tom Emory, one of his men, who was stuck on the
light mountain air of New Mexico remain with me.
This left me there with a cook and three warriors,
Emory, Chambers and "Big-foot" Wallace.</p>

<p>Just as soon as "Bob" had pulled out, I moved
into town and rented a house, so that we could
put on style, while waiting for the money I had
written to the ranch for.</p>

<p>The mails were so irregular, on account of the
deep snow which lay on the ground up there in the
mountains nearly all winter, that I didn't get a letter
from Moore for three weeks. In the letter were
drafts for three hundred dollars; and Moore stated
that I had done just right by not taking Stuart's
advice and coming home. He also reminded me that
I mustn't come back until I got the cattle, if it took
two years; and also that I must scour out the Sand
hills on the Plains around Las Potales, "Kid's" den,
on my return. I distributed the three hundred dollars
among my creditors and then wrote back to the
ranch for some more, as that was already gone, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>We found the citizens of White Oaks to be sociable
and kind; and everything went on lovely with the
exception of a shooting scrape between a School
teacher and "Big foot."</p>

<p>About the last of February I received another
three hundred dollars and I then struck out, accompanied
by Tom Emory, to hunt the noted Pat
Cohglin and find out if he would let us have the cattle
without bloodshed or not. As he had a slaughter
house in Fort Stanton I struck out for there first.</p>

<p>We left the "Oaks" one morning early, Emory
mounted on his pet "Grey" and I on one of the fat
work mules and arrived in "Stanton" about sundown.</p>

<p>We rode up to Cohglin's slaughter pen the first
thing and found a man by the name of Peppen in
charge. On examining the hides which hung on
the fence we found five bearing the "L. X." brand.
I laid them to one side and next morning brought
two men Crawford and Hurly, down from the Post
to witness the brands. I then told Mr. Peppen, or
"Old Pap" as he was called, not to butcher any
more of those cattle sold by "Billy the Kid." He
promised he wouldn't unless he got new orders
from Cohglin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>From there we pulled for Tulerosa where Cohglin
lived. The first night out we stopped at the Mescalero
Apache Indian Agency, which is known as
South Fork. There I learned from the storekeeper
of a bunch of eight hundred cattle having passed
there in a terrible hurry, about three weeks before,
going west. He said that they were undoubtedly
stolen cattle, for they drove night and day
through the deep snow. I came to the conclusion
that maybe it was Tom Cooper, one of "Kid's" right-hand
bowers with a stolen herd of Panhandle cattle,
so made up my mind to keep on his trail.</p>

<p>We rode into Tulerosa the next evening about
sundown. A young man from the Panhandle, by
the name of Sam Coleman, who was on his way to
Willcox, Arizona, was with us. We found the town
to be a genuine mexican "Plaza" of about one
thousand souls. We put up for the night at Cohglin's
store and learned from the clerk, Morris, that
the "King of Tulerosa," as Cohglin was called, was
down on the Rio Grande on trail of a bunch of cattle
stolen from him by Tom Cooper. I put that down
as a very thin yarn, having reasons to believe that
he and Cooper stood in with one another. I made
up my mind that it was our cattle he was trying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to get away with, after hearing of us being in the
"Oaks."</p>

<p>The clerk had told the truth though, for he was
after Cooper. The way it happened, Cohglin had
only paid Cooper and the "Kid" half down on the
last bunch of Panhandle cattle he bought from them
and Cooper hearing of "Kid's" capture and of us
being in the "Oaks" on our way after the cattle,
came onto Cohglin for the rest of the money so he
could leave the country. On being refused he got his
crowd together and stole three hundred head of the
latter's best cattle and pulled for Arizona with them.</p>

<p>After supper Emory and Coleman went to bed
while I struck out to a mexican dance, at the outskirts
of town, to keep my ears open for news
connected with Panhandle cattle, etc.</p>

<p>There being plenty of wine, or "mescal," on the
ground the "Greasers" began feeling pretty good
about midnight. Of course I had to join in their
sports, so as to keep on the good side of them.
There was only one American in the crowd, besides
myself.</p>

<p>I became pretty intimate with one old fellow of
whom I made scores of inquiries in regard to Mr.
Cohglin and the herd&mdash;the one I heard about at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
South Fork&mdash;that had passed there a few weeks
before.</p>

<p>He knew nothing of the herd, no further than
having seen it, but he pointed out a long-haired
"Greaser," who was three sheets in the wind and
swinging his pistol around on his fore-finger, who
could tell me all about it, as he had piloted it through
San Augustine Pass.</p>

<p>I learned that the herd was owned by Charlie
Slaughter and that their destination was the Heeley
River, near Tombstone, Arizona.</p>

<p>Marking out a lot of brands which I had never
heard of on a piece of paper, I asked the long-haired
fellow if he noticed any of them on the cattle. He
did not. So I then marked off a lot of Panhandle
brands. He picked out several, the "L X." among
them, this time, that he remembered of seeing in
the herd. This satisfied me that the herd would
bear inspection.</p>

<p>The next morning I told Emory what the old
mexican had said and that my intentions were to kill
two birds with one stone; find Cohglin and then
follow the herd.</p>

<p>This didn't impress Emory very favorably. He
advised me to return and get the wagon and outfit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
I couldn't see the point, for we would lose at least
a week by the operation. He took the back track
while I continued single handed, accompanied by
Sam Coleman, whose route was the same as mine
until arriving on the Rio Grande, where he would
change his course to southward.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">WAYLAID BY UNKNOWN PARTIES.</p>

<p>After leaving Tulerosa our route lay across a
young desert, called the "White Sands," a distance
of sixty miles. That night Sam and I camped
at a lonely spot called "White Water," where there
wasn't a stick of wood in sight. We had to make
a fire out of a bush called the "oil weed" to keep
warm by.</p>

<p>The next night we put up with an old man by the
name of Shedd, who kept a ranch on the east side
of Osscuro mountains, near San Augustine Pass.</p>

<p>On arriving in the Pass next morning, on our
way to Las Cruces, we could see the whole Rio
Grande valley, dotted with green fields, for at least
a hundred miles up and down. And by looking
over our shoulder, in the direction we had come,
we could see the white looking plain or desert, which
extends for two hundred miles north and south. It
was indeed a beautiful sight, to one who had just
come from a snowy country, and we were loath to
leave the spot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Arriving in Las Cruces, (City of the Crosses) on
the Rio Grande, twenty-five miles from Shedd's
where we had left that morning, I went to making
inquiries about Mr. Pat Cohglin's whereabouts. I
found out by the Postmaster, Cunnifee, who was an
intimate friend of his that he was in El Paso,
Texas, fifty miles below, and would be up to "Cruces"
the next day.</p>

<p>That night Sam and I proceeded to take in the
town, which was booming, on account of the A. T.
and S. F. R. R. being only forty miles above, and
on its way down the river to El Paso.</p>

<p>The next morning Sam bid me adieu and struck
out on his journey for Willcox, Arizona, about two
hundred miles distant.</p>

<p>That evening Mr. Cohglin, whom I found to be a
large, portly looking half-breed Irishman, drove up
to Mr. Cunnifee's store in a buggy drawn by a fine
pair of black horses.</p>

<p>I introduced myself as having been sent from the
Panhandle after the cattle he had purchased from
the "Kid." He at first said I couldn't have them,
but finally changed his tone, when I told him that I
had a crowd at White Oaks, and that my instructions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
were to take them by force if I couldn't secure
them in any other way.</p>

<p>He then began giving me "taffy," as I learned
afterwards. He promised faithfully that, as he
didn't like to have his whole herd, which was scattered
through the whole White Mountain district,
disturbed at that season of the year, if I would wait
until the first of April, at which time the new grass
would be up, he would help me round-up every hoof
of Panhandle cattle on his range. I agreed to do
so providing he would promise not to have any more
of them butchered at "Stanton."</p>

<p>The old fellow was worried considerably about
the three hundred head of cattle Cooper had stolen
from him. He told me about having followed him
with a crowd of mexicans into the Black Range,
near the Arizona line, where he succeeded in getting
back a few of the broken-down ones.</p>

<p>There being a fellow by the name of "Hurricane
Bill," of Ft. Griffin, Texas notoriety, in town, direct
from Tombstone, Arizona, I concluded to lay over
a few days and "play in" with him and his gang of
four or five, in hopes of learning something about
Slaughter and his herd, the one I was on trail of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>I went under an assumed name and told them that
I was on the "dodge" for a crime committed in
Southern Texas.</p>

<p>I found out all about their future plans from one
of the gang, by the name of Johnson, who seemed
to be more talkative than the rest. He said they
were waiting for the railroad to get to El Paso;
and then they were going into the butchering business
on a large scale. He wanted me to join them;
and said the danger wouldn't be very great, as they
intended stealing the cattle mostly from ignorant
mexicans.</p>

<p>One morning while Johnson and I were eating
breakfast at a restaurant a man sat down at the
same table and, recognizing me, said: "Hello," calling
me by name; "where did you come from?" He
then continued; although I winked at him several
times to keep still, "So you fellows succeeded in
capturing Billy the Kid, did you?" etc.</p>

<p>Johnson gave a savage glance at me as much as
to say: d&mdash;&mdash;m you, you have been trying to work
us, have you? I kept my hand near old colts "45"
for I expected, from his nervous actions, for him to
make a break of some kind. He finally got up and
walked out without saying a word. This man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
had so suddenly bursted our friendship was a friend
of Frank Stuart's and had met me in Las Vegas,
with his chum, Stuart.</p>

<p>I concluded it wouldn't be healthy for me to remain
there till after dark, nor to undertake the trip
to Tombstone, for I had manifested such an interest
in the Slaughter herd, etc., that they might follow
me up, on hearing that I had left town. So I
wrote a letter to Mr. Moore, telling him of the whole
circumstances, and asking him if I had better take
my men and follow the herd to the jumping-off place
or not? I then struck back to White Oaks over the
same route I had come.</p>

<p>That night I stopped at Shedd's ranch; and so
did Cohglin, he being on his way back to Tulerosa.</p>

<p>The next day I rode the entire sixty miles, across
the "white sands," and landed in Tulerosa about a
half hour behind Cohglin and his fast steppers. I
was tired though, and swore off ever riding another
mule on a long trip. I had figured on being in
mountains all the time, where I would have lots of
climbing to do, is why I rode the mule instead of a
horse.</p>

<p>The next morning I made up my mind that I
would take a new route to the "Oaks" by going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
around the mountains through Mr. Cohglin's range
which was on Three Rivers, twenty odd miles north.
So before starting I inquired of Cohglin's clerk as
to the best route, etc.</p>

<p>I stopped at the Cohglin ranch that night and was
treated like a white head by Mr. Nesbeth and wife
who took care of the ranch, that is, done the cooking,
gardening, milking, etc. The herders, or cowboys,
were all mexicans, with the exception of Bill
Gentry, the boss, who was away at the time.</p>

<p>While getting ready to start for White Oaks next
morning one of the eight or ten, mexicans, who
were sitting on the fence sunning themselves, came
to me, and told me of a near cut to the "Oaks," by
taking an old Indian trail over the White Mountains,
and advised me to take that route as I could save
at least twenty miles, it being forty around by the
road.</p>

<p>Mr. Nesbeth spoke up and said it would be better
for me to travel on the road, even if it was further,
as I might experience some difficulty in finding the
old Indian trail, etc.</p>

<p>The "Greaser" then offered me his service, saying
that he would go and put me on the trail so that
it would be impossible for me to miss my way. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
agreed, so he mounted a pony and we rode east up
a rough canyon.</p>

<p>A ride of about five miles brought us to the
almost obliterated trail. It lead up an awful brushy
and rocky canyon towards the snowy crags of the
White Mountain range.</p>

<p>About an hour after bidding the "Greaser" adieu,
I came to where the trail made a short curve to the
left, but I could tell from the lay of the ground that,
by keeping straight ahead, I would strike it again.
So I left it, and luckily for me that I did, for there
was some one laying for me not far from there.</p>

<p>I hadn't gone but a rod or two when bang! bang!
bang! went three shots in quick succession, not over
fifty yards to the left; and at the same time my
mule gave a lunge forward, on the ice-covered
stones, and fell broad-side, throwing me over a precipice
about eight feet to the bottom. My winchester
and pistol both were hanging to the saddle-horn,
but I managed to grab and pull the latter out
of the scabbard as I went off, and took it with me.</p>

<p>The first thing I done on striking bottom was to
hunt a hole. I found a nice little nook between two
boulders and lay there with cocked pistol, expecting
every second to see three Indians or "Greasers"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
peep over the ledge on the hunt for a dead "Gringo"&mdash;as
the mexicans call an American.</p>

<p>After waiting a few minutes I became impatient
and crawled on top of a small knoll and, on looking
in the direction the shooting had come from, I got
a faint glimpse of what I took to be two half-stooped
human forms retreating, through the pinyon brush,
at a lively gait. Suffice it to say I found my mule
standing in a grove of trees, with his front feet fastened
in the bridle-reins, about two hundred yards
from where he fell. And between his forelegs, on
the ground was a small pool of sparkling red blood,
which had dripped from a slight bullet wound in his
breast.</p>

<p>On examination I found that one bullet had cut
a groove in the hind tree of my saddle, and another
had plowed through a pair of blankets tied behind
the saddle. I arrived in the Oaks, on my almost
broken-down mule about dark that night, after an
absence of nearly two weeks.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">LOST ON THE STAKED PLAINS.</p>

<p>About a week after my return to White Oaks, I
received a letter from Mr. Moore stating that
I need not go to Arizona to look after the Slaughter
herd as he had hired a United States Deputy Marshal
by the name of John W. Poe, now Sheriff of
Lincoln County, New Mexico, to go around by rail
and tend to the matter. But when Poe arrived there
the herd had been sold and driven to Old Mexico,
so that we never knew whether there were any Panhandle
cattle in it or not, except what I learned
from the mexican, which appeared to me very good
evidence, that there were.</p>

<p>On the tenth day of March, while taking it easy
waiting for the first of April to arrive so that we
could round up the Cohglin range according to
agreement, I received a confidential letter from Mr.
Geo. Nesbeth of the Cohglin ranch, giving me a
broad hint that Mr. Cohglin was getting rid of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
cattle as fast as possible, before the first of April
should arrive.</p>

<p>The letter arrived in the evening and next morning
I took "Big foot" along and struck out for
"Stanton"&mdash;after giving Chambers and Emory orders
to load up the wagon with grub and corn, and
follow.</p>

<p>"Big-foot" and I arrived in the Post about three
o'clock in the afternoon and went through the Cohglin
slaughter pens, finding several freshly butchered
"L. X." hides, which went to show that I had been
duped, and that the hint from Nesbeth was true.
We then rode down the "Bonetta" River nine miles
to Lincoln, to go through the hides there and to
look for a herd we expected the old fellow had hidden
out somewhere along the river.</p>

<p>We stopped in "Stanton" that night and next
morning struck out on the White Oaks road to meet
the wagon and turn it towards Three Rivers.</p>

<p>We met the outfit at the mouth of Nogal canyon
and camped for dinner.</p>

<p>It was sixty miles around by the road to Cohglin's
ranch, the route the wagon would have to go and
about twenty-five or thirty on a straight line over
the White Mountains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner "Big-foot" and I struck out over the
mountains, while Emory and Chambers went around
by the road to pilot the cook, etc.</p>

<p>About twelve o'clock that night, after a very hard
ride over one of the roughest strips of snow covered
countries a man ever saw, we arrived at the
Cohglin ranch.</p>

<p>We found the corral full of cattle, but, being very
dark, couldn't tell whose they were.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Nesbeth got up out of bed and gave
us a cold supper; and he also gave us a few pointers
in regard to his employer's doings, etc. He informed
me that Bill Gentry, the boss, had just
began, that day, gathering the remaining Panhandle
cattle, that might still be left on the range, to take
to the "Stanton" slaughter pens. Hence those
cattle in the corral.</p>

<p>After breakfast Gentry and his seven "Greasers"
turned the herd out of the corral with the intention
of keeping right on with his work. There was
only five head of "L. X.'s," all large steers, in the
bunch and I told Gentry that I would have to take
charge of those and also gather up the rest that
were on his range. He couldn't agree to that, he
said, for his orders from Cohglin were, not to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
up any of the Panhandle cattle, etc. I told him
that I didn't care what his orders were, as I was
bound to have the cattle.</p>

<p>Just about the time we were arguing the case the
rest of my outfit hove in sight; they had been traveling
all night.</p>

<p>After camping the wagon we all went out to the
herd, which the mexicans were guarding and proceeded
to cutting our five head out. Gentry tried to
get me to wait until he could send for Cohglin, he
having already dispatched a mexican to Tulerosa
after him, but I wouldn't reason the matter at all,
as I was mad about the way I had been served.</p>

<p>We went right to work after cutting out the five
head, rounding up the whole range in search of
more, but after three days hard work we only succeeded
in finding three head more. But we left
there with nine head, the ninth one being one of
Cohglin's own steers which we butchered in the
Oaks on our arrival back there, for the benefit of
our many friends whom had been depending on us
all winter for their fresh beef. Thus I had the satisfaction
of getting even with the old fellow to the
extent of one steer and a fat hog which we had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
butchered and stowed away in the wagon the night
before leaving.</p>

<p>The mexican that Gentry sent to Tulerosa with
the dispatch had to go on down to Las Cruces, on
the Rio Grande, Cohglin having started down there
the day before; hence we not having the old fellow
to contend with.</p>

<p>After looking over the "Carezo" range, which
was owned by Catron and Waltz and several small
mexican ranges, we pulled into White Oaks with
lots of experience but very few cattle.</p>

<p>On arriving in the "Oaks" I wrote to Mr. Moore
telling him all about the way in which Cohglin
had taken advantage of me, etc. Also advised
him to have the old fellow prosecuted as I had
sufficient evidence to send him to the "Pen," etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore on getting my letter, sent John Poe,
the United States Deputy Marshal that he had
sent to Tombstone, Arizona, over to have Cohglin
arrested and put through the mill.</p>

<p>On leaving the "Oaks" for good, I bought a
wagon load of corn, chuck, etc. for which I gave
orders on the "L. X." company, not having any
money left. The merchants had by this time, become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
acquainted with me, so that my name to an
order was just the same as cash to them.</p>

<p>From the "Oaks" I pulled due east, around the
"Capitan" mountains to Roswell on the Pecos River.
I overhauled scores of little mexican ranches scattered
through the mountains on my route, but failed
to find any of our stock. At Roswell though we
found two large steers which swelled our little herd
to ten head.</p>

<p>From Roswell we went to John Chisholm's ranch
on the head of South Spring River; and got there
just in time as he was rigging up his outfit for spring
work. They were going to start down the Reo
Pecos to the Texas line, next day, to begin work
and I concluded we had better work with them, in
search of Panhandle cattle which might have drifted
across the Plains.</p>

<p>I took my outfit back to Roswell, five miles,
where I made arrangements with Capt. J. C. Lea,
who kept a store, to board one of my men whom I
wanted to leave there to take care of the ten head of
steers until my return, not caring to drive them two
hundred miles down the river and then back again.</p>

<p>Not having grub enough to last on the trip I
bought a supply from the accommodating Capt. Lea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
who took my note for pay. He also sold me two
horses on the same terms.</p>

<p>We were absent two weeks on this trip, but
failed to find any of our cattle. We came back
with the satisfaction though of knowing that there
wasn't any in that part of the world.</p>

<p>On our arrival back to Roswell we learned of the
"Kid's" escape from Lincoln after having killed his
two guards. That night Lon Chambers wore a
different hat; he had swapped his star-spangled
mexican sombraro off to one of Chisholm's men.
This hat had been presented to Tom O'Phalliard by
the "Kid," hence Chambers not wanting it in his
possession for fear he might run across the "Kid."
Chambers of course denied the above, saying that
he never thought of such a thing, but traded it off
just because it, being so heavy, made his head ache.
But that was too thin we thought under the circumstances.
Any of us would have done the same
though, no doubt, knowing that the "Kid" had
sworn vengeance against all of O'Phalliard's "murderers"
as he termed them.</p>

<p>We found Emory and the ten steers doing finely.
Tom hated to see us back for he was having such
a soft time. All he had to do was turn the steers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
out of the corral, mornings, and then round-up and
pen them at night again.</p>

<p>After drawing on the whole-souled Capt. Lea
again for more grub, etc., we pulled up the Reo
Pecos&mdash;looking through all the cattle on our route&mdash;to
Ft. Sumner, a distance of one hundred miles.</p>

<p>We laid over in Sumner two days and went to
a mexican fandango both nights, at the Maxwell
mansion in which the "Kid" was killed shortly afterwards.
The "Kid" was in the building while the
dance was going on but we didn't know it at the
time. The way I found it out, I had escorted a
young woman, after the dance, one night, to her
room, which was in the same building as the dance,
and she bid me good night without asking me in.
I thought it strange but never said anything. That
fall when I came back there she explained matters,
by saying that the "Kid" was in her room at the
time, reading. I had noticed that she stood outside
of the door until I had turned the corner out of
sight. She also explained that: The "Kid" had
the door locked and she had to give a private rap to
get him to open it.</p>

<p>From Ft. Sumner we pulled due east on the Los
Potales road, on our way to scour out the "Sand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Hills" according to Moore's instruction in one of
his letters to me at White Oaks. Before leaving the
Post, the last settlement or store that we would come
to before reaching the Canadian River, I sold one
of the horses bought from Capt. Lea, for thirty-five
dollars and laid in a small supply of grub with the
money. Not being acquainted there my credit
wasn't good, hence having to sell the horse.</p>

<p>Two days out from Ft. Sumner we came to the
little rock house, at Stinking Springs, where the
"Kid" and his companions held out so long without
fire, food or water. Chambers and Emory of course
had to explain and point out every place of interest,
to "Big-foot Wallace," the mexican cook, Frank, or
Francisco, and myself.</p>

<p>The second day after leaving Stinking Springs,
we came to the "Kid's" noted "Castle" at Los Potales,
on the western edge of the great "Llano
Estacado."</p>

<p>Los Potales is a large alkali Lake, the water of
which is unfit for man or beast. But on the north
side of the lake is two nice, cool springs which gurgle
forth from a bed of rock, near the foot of
"Kid's" Castle&mdash;a small cave in the cliff. In front
of the cave is a stone corral about fifty feet square;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and above the cave on the level plain is several
hitching posts. Outside of those things mentioned
there is nothing but a level prairie just as far as the
eye can reach.</p>

<p>We found about one hundred head of cattle,
mostly from the Canadian River, but a few from as
far north as Denver Col., at "Potales," which improved
the appearance of our little herd considerably.</p>

<p>From there we went to the Coyote lake, twelve
miles further east, where we found about fifty head
more cattle, a mixed lot like the first. They were
almost as wild as deer.</p>

<p>We then pulled into the Sand Hills, which extend
over a scope of country from ten to fifty miles wide,
and two hundred long&mdash;that is, two hundred miles
north and south.</p>

<p>After about ten days hard work we came out onto
the Plains again, our herd having increased to about
twenty-five hundred head. We were undoubtedly
a worn out crowd&mdash;horses and all. To do that
amount of work we should have had at least five
more men, and three or four more horses apiece.
We only had one horse apiece, besides one extra,
and the four work mules, which we had to press<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
into double duty by using them to guard the cattle
at night.</p>

<p>The next day about noon, after getting out of the
Sand Hills, we came to a buffalo-hunter's camp on
the head of Yellow-house canyon, a tributary to the
Brazos River. There was one man in camp, the
other one being away on a hunt. Our cattle being
nearly dead for water, there being none there, with
the exception of a small spring, just large enough
to allow one animal to drink at a time, I asked the
hunter to give me directions to the nearest water
from there, on our route.</p>

<p>Pointing to a cluster of sand hills about fifteen
miles to the east, he said: "You will find Running
Water, the head of Canyon Blanco, just eight miles
east of those sand hills." As we learned, after it
was too late, he should have said; eight miles <i>north</i>
of the sand hills, instead of <i>east</i>. We were all
acquainted with the country from Running Water
north, but had never been south of it; hence us
having to depend on the "locoed" buffalo-hunter's
directions.</p>

<p>We camped for the night within a few miles of
the sand hills. The cattle were restless all night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
on account of being thirsty, which caused us all to
lose sleep and rest.</p>

<p>The next morning, after eating a hasty breakfast,
we let the moaning herd string out towards the big
red sun which was just making its appearance.</p>

<p>Giving the boys orders to keep headed east, and
telling the cook to follow behind the herd with his
wagon, I struck out ahead on my tired and weak
pony, Croppy, to find the water, which was "so
near, and yet so far."</p>

<p>I rode about fifteen miles, and still no water. I
then dismounted to wait for the herd to come in
sight, but changed my notion and galloped on five
miles further, thinking maybe the hunter might have
meant eighteen miles instead of eight. The five
miles was reached and still nothing but a dry, level
plain, with no indications of water ahead, as far as
I could see.</p>

<p>Thinking maybe I had bore too far to the south, I
then rode five or six miles to the north, but with
the same result. I then, after letting Croppy blow
awhile started back towards the herd at a slow gait.</p>

<p>Finally a cloud of dust appeared, and shortly
after, the herd hove in sight. The poor cattle were
coming in a trot, their tongues hanging out a foot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The way the boys cursed and abused that poor
old hunter, at a distance, was a sin, after I had told
them of our luck. Chambers wanted to go right
back and eat the poor "locoed" human up alive without
salt or pepper. But I pacified him by saying that
maybe he had made a mistake of a few miles, meant
eighty instead of eight. At any rate we continued
right on, east.</p>

<p>About noon our ten-gallon keg run dry, and then
we began to feel ticklish, scared, or whatever you
wish to call it. But about three o'clock, we spied
a bunch of mustangs off to the right, about five
miles, and on galloping over to where they had been,
before seeing me, I found a small pool of muddy
rain water, which they had been wallowing in.</p>

<p>After letting Croppy fill up, and eating a drink of
the muddy stuff myself, I struck back to let the other
boys come on and fill up; also sent the cook to fill
the keg, and to water his mules, I kept the herd,
they being anxious to travel in search of water,
pointed east, by myself, while the rest of the boys
were absent.</p>

<p>We traveled till midnight and then pitched camp
to get something to eat. After getting supper
cooked, it was almost an impossibility to find time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
to eat it, as the herd kept milling and trotting around
like so many crazy animals.</p>

<p>We remained there all night, and next morning
used the last drop of water to make coffee. We
found the keg, after draining it, to be about half
full of solid mud.</p>

<p>I concluded that we had gone far enough east, so,
that morning changed our course to north.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock, while the hot June sun was
coming down with vengeance, we struck a large
lake about a mile wide. If ever a crowd was happy
it was us. The poor cattle drank till some of them
fell down and was unable to move.</p>

<p>We laid there resting up until the next day after
dinner. Our grub had given out by this time, therefore
we had nothing to eat but coffee and beef
"straight."</p>

<p>When we left the lake our course was due north.</p>

<p>About noon the next day we came to the head of
Canyon Blanco, twelve miles below Running Water,
consequently we turned west, and traveled twelve
miles up the dry canyon before pitching camp.</p>

<p>From there we turned due north again and traveled
two days before striking any more water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>On arriving at Terra Blanco, fifty miles south of
the Canadian river we struck Mr. Summerfield, and
his outfit, from whom we borrowed grub enough to
last us home. There were also two "L. X." boys
in the Summerfield camp, and they, having five good
horses apiece, divided with us. Our ponies were
just about completely peetered out.</p>

<p>We landed at the "L. X." ranch on the 22nd day
of June, with the herd of twenty-five hundred head
of cattle, after having been absent just seven months,
to a day.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A TRIP DOWN THE REO PECOS.</p>

<p>On my return I found that the "L. X." ranch had
changed bosses. Moore had quit and bought
a ranch of his own, while John Hollicott, one of the
old hands had been put in his place. Hence in the
future I had to be governed by Mr. Hollicott's
orders&mdash;that is while working around the ranch.
One of the firm, Erskine Clement, had charge of
outside matters, now, since Moore had left.</p>

<p>I put in the summer running a branding outfit,
loafing around Tascosa, working up a cattle stealing
case, etc., until the middle of October, when
Clement received a letter from John Poe, who was
prosecuting Cohglin, stating for Chambers and I to
come over to Lincoln as witnesses in the Cohglin
case. The time set for us to be there, was on the
7th day of November, therefore we had no time to
lose, it being five hundred miles over there, by the
shortest route.</p>

<p>Hollicott and Clement talked the matter over and
concluded that I had better not come back until the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
next spring&mdash;"just put in the winter drifting over the
country, wherever you can do the most good," was
my orders.</p>

<p>Chambers and I struck out from Tascosa on
the 22nd of October. He had only one horse,
while I had two of the best animals on the ranch,
Croppy and Buckshot.</p>

<p>We traveled up the river to Liberty, New Mexico,
and from there cut across the Staked Plains to Ft.
Sumner, on the Reo Pecos.</p>

<p>The distance from "Sumner" to the "Oaks"
was about one hundred miles on a bee line across
the country, while it was one hundred and fifty
around by the road. We chose the former route,
although we were told that there wasn't any
water until reaching the Capitan mountains within
thirty miles of the "Oaks." We both wished though,
that we had followed the road, for, our progress being
very slow on account of the loose dirt which
would give away under a horse, allowing him to
sink almost to his knees, we came very near perishing
from thirst; and so did our poor horses.</p>

<p>We landed in White Oaks about noon of the
fourth day out from Ft. Sumner; and had been on
the road twelve days from Tascosa. We were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
welcomed back to the "Oaks" by all of our old
acquaintances, especially those whom we had
furnished with stolen beef all winter.</p>

<p>As we had five days to loaf in, before court set
in, we went to work prospecting for gold, every
body in the town being at fever heat over recent
rich strikes.</p>

<p>The first day was spent in climbing to the top of
Baxter mountain, where most of the rich mines
were located, and back. The only thing we found
of interest was a lot of genuine oyster shells imbedded
in a large rock on the extreme top of the
mountain. Of course this brought up a discussion
as to how they came there. Chambers contended
that they grew there during the flood, and I argued
that they were there before God made the earth.
We both finally got mad, each one, over the other's
weak argument, and began to slide down hill towards
town, which looked something like a checkerboard
from where we were.</p>

<p>The next day we tied the pick and shovel behind
our saddles and struck out on horseback to prospect
in the valleys. At last we struck it, a fine gold
bearing lead. It cropped out of the ground about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
a foot. I told Chambers to go to work and dig the
prospect-hole, while I wrote out the location notices.</p>

<p>Finally an old miner by the name of Stone came
to us. I was sitting under the shade of a pinyon
tree writing, while Chambers was sweating like a
"Nigger at election." "What are you fellows trying
to do?" spoke up Mr. Stone, after grinning a few
moments. We told him. He then said: "Why
neither one of you fellows has got as much sense
as a last year's bird's nest; that's nothing but a very
common ledge of rock." We took him at his word
and went back to town.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Stone gave us one of his mines,
if we would sink a twenty foot shaft on it. We
done so; that is, Chambers did, while I carried
water, and rode into town every day at noon to
bring him out his dinner.</p>

<p>Finally our time was out and we had to pull for
Lincoln, a distance of thirty-five miles. Poe had
written to me to come in after night, and on the sly,
as he wanted to make Cohglin believe that we
wouldn't be there to appear against him, so he
would let his trial come off, instead of taking a
change of venue. I left Croppy in a feed stable to
be taken care of until my return.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Arriving in Lincoln, Poe sent us down the Reo
Bonetta, twelve miles, to stop with a Mr. Cline,
with whom he had made arrangements, until sent
for.</p>

<p>Mr. Cline was a Dutchman who had married a
mexican wife and had a house full of little half-breeds
around him.</p>

<p>Time passed off very slowly to Chambers and I,
although our host tried to amuse us by telling his
hairbreadth escapes from wild indians and grizzly-bears.</p>

<p>We were indeed glad when Mr. Poe rode up, after
we had been at the Cline ranch twelve days, and
told us that we were free. Cohglin had "smelled a
mice" and taken a change of venue to Mesilla, in
Dona Anna County.</p>

<p>Before leaving Lincoln I had to sign a five hundred
dollar bond for my appearance in Mesilla, as a
witness against Cohglin, on the first Monday in
April, 1882, which was the following spring. Mr.
Chambers being sworn and not knowing anything
of importance, was allowed to return home. We
both received ninety dollars apiece, for mileage and
witness fees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Returning to White Oaks, Chambers remained
there a week, making love to his mexican widow,
and then struck for the "L. X." ranch, by way of
Anton Chico, and down the Canadian River. The
route he and I had come was too far between ranches
for him, traveling alone.</p>

<p>I remained in the "Oaks" about a week after my
"pard" had left, waiting for some more money
which I had written for.</p>

<p>From the "Oaks" I went to Roswell on the Reo
Pecos, a distance of one hundred and twenty-five
miles, by the route I took. There I struck company,
a jovial old soul by the name of "Ash" Upson,
who was just starting to the Texas Pacific Railroad,
two hundred miles down the river, to meet Pat.
Garrett, who had written to come there after him,
in a buggy. Ash was making his home at Garrett's
ranch, a few miles from Roswell.</p>

<p>We laid over Christmas day at the mouth of Seven
Rivers and helped kind Mrs. Jones, one of Mr.
Upson's old-time friends, get away with a nice turkey
dinner.</p>

<p>While sitting around our camp-fire at nights "Old"
Ash would amuse me by relating circumstances connected
with the "bloody Lincoln County war." He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
also gave me a full sketch of "Billy the Kid's" life,
a subject which I am going to devote the next chapter
to, as I imagine it will be interesting reading to
some.</p>

<p>We arrived at Pecos Station, on the T. P. R. R.,
one afternoon about three o'clock. And it being a
terribly lonesome place, we, after leaving our horses
and things in care of an old wolf hunter who promised
to see that the horses were well fed, boarded
the west bound passenger train for Toyah, a distance
of twenty-two miles.</p>

<p>We put up at the Alverado House, in Toyah. It
was kept by a man named Newell, who had a pretty
little fifteen-year old daughter, whose sparkling eyes
were too much for me; to use a western phrase,
she broke me all up on the first round.</p>

<p>After supper Ash went out to take in the town,
while I remained in the office exchanging glances
with Miss Bulah.</p>

<p>It was New Year's eve and Mr. and Mrs. Newell
were making preparations for a ball to be given
New Year's night.</p>

<p>Toyah was then one of those terrible wicked infant
towns, it being only a few months old and contained
over a dozen saloons and gambling halls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>About midnight Ash got through taking in the
town and came back to the hotel. He was three
sheets in the wind, but swore he hadn't drank anything
but "Tom and Jerry."</p>

<p>The next morning the town was full of railroaders,
they having come in to spend New Years. A grand
shooting match for turkeys was advertised to come
off at ten o'clock, and everybody, railroaders and all,
were cleaning up their pistols, when Ash and I got
up, we having slept till about nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Miss Bulah made a remark, in my presence, that
she wished someone would win a fat turkey and
give it to her. Now was my time to make a "mash,"
so I assured her that I would bring in a dozen or
two and lay them at her feet.</p>

<p>When the shooting commenced I was on hand
and secured the ticket which was marked number
eleven. The tickets were sold at twenty-five cents
apiece, and if you killed the bird, you were entitled
to a free shot until you missed.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller, the Justice, was running the business
for what money there was in it. He had sent to
Dallas, six hundred miles east, after the turkeys,
which had cost him three dollars apiece. Hence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
he had to regulate the distance and everything so
that there would be considerable missing done.</p>

<p>Everything being ready, he placed the turkey in
an iron box, with nothing but its head visible and
then set the box thirty-five yards from the line. The
shooting to be done with pistols "off hand."</p>

<p>Ten shots were fired and still Mr. turkey was
casting shy glances towards the large crowd of
several hundred men. Mr. Miller wore a pleasant
smile, when he shouted number eleven.</p>

<p>I stepped forward trembling like an aspen leaf,
for fear I would miss and thereby fail to win Miss
Bulah's admiration. I was afraid, should the bullet
miss its mark, that the few dozen birds would be
all killed before my time would come around again,
there being so many men waiting for a shot. At
last I cut loose and off went the turkey's head, also
Mr. Miller's happy smile. You see he lacked "two
bits" of getting cost for the bird.</p>

<p>Another one was put up, and off went his head.
This was too much for Mr. Miller, two birds already
gone and only two dollars and "six bits" in the pot.
He finally after humming and hawing awhile, said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I don't like to weaken this early in
the game, but you all know I have got a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
family to support and consequently I will have to
rule this young man out of the ring. He's too slick
with a pistol to have around a game of this kind
anyway."</p>

<p>I hated to quit of course, but it was best, for I
might have missed the very next time, and as it was
Bulah would think that I would have carried out my
promise if I had been allowed to keep on.</p>

<p>After that, during my stay on the T. P. R. R., I
was called the "Turkey shooter." Often while
riding near the railroad track, maybe four or five
hundred miles from Toyah, some one would hail
me from a passing train by that name; and whenever
I would ride into a town there was sure to be
some fellow on hand to point me out. They all
knew me so well by my horse, Croppy, he being
milk white and both ears being off close up to his
head. He was indeed a notable animal, as well as
a long, keen, good one.</p>

<p>That night nearly everybody got drunk, old Ash
excepted of course, as he was already full. The
ball was a grand success. The dancers on the womens'
side, were all married ladies, with the exception
of Miss Bulah and a Miss Lee; and those on
the opposite side were a terribly mixed mob, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
mostly gamblers, horse thieves and cow boys. The
railroaders didn't take any stock in the ball. Maybe
it was because there were so many on the floor
wearing six-shooters and bowie knives around their
waists.</p>

<p>It was indeed a grand sight next morning looking
at black eyes and swollen heads. Every Chinaman,
there being a dozen or two living in town, skipped
for parts unknown that night. There was too many
loose bullets flying through the air to suit them; and
it is said that the "Pig-tails" have shunned Toyah
ever since that New Year's night.</p>

<p>A few days after New Years a telegram came to
Ash, from Garrett who had arrived at Pecos Station
stating: "Come on the first train as I am in a hurry
to get home." Ash got me to answer it as he, having
drank too much Tom and Jerry, was unable to
walk to the Telegraph office. I sent the following
message: "Can't leave here; owe every man in
town."</p>

<p>In a few minutes another one came, an answer to
the one just sent, stating: "If you don't come down
on the morning train I will strike out and leave
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>This one raised Ash's spunk, so he told me to
write down just what he told me, and then give it
to the operator. I done as requested, which ran
thus: "Go to, hic, h&mdash;l, d&mdash;&mdash; you!"</p>

<p>The next evening, Garrett arrived on the west
bound passenger, and next morning, after paying
a lot of saloon bills, etc., took old Ash back with
him.</p>

<p>I had, the day after New Year's, went down to
the Pecos and brought my ponies up to Toyah,
therefore I took a little spin out into the country to
pass off the time, every now and then, or at least
to look through a few herds of cattle in that vicinity.</p>

<p>After spending about two weeks around Toyah,
I struck out for Colorado City, two hundred miles
east. Of course I hated to part with Miss Bulah;
and so did Mr. Newell hate to part with me, for he
was losing a good cash boarder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A TRUE SKETCH OF "BILLY THE KID'S" LIFE.</p>

<p>The cut on opposite page was taken from a photograph
and represents the "Kid" as he appeared
before the artist after having just returned from a
long, tiresome raid; and the following sketch of his
short but eventful life was gleaned from himself,
Ash Upson and others. The circumstance connected
with his death I got from the lips of John
W. Poe, who was with Garrett when he fired the
fatal shot.</p>

<p>Billy Bonney, alias the "Kid" was born in New
York City, November the 23rd, 1859; and at the
age of ten he, in company with his mother and step-father,
Antrim, landed in the Territory of New
Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. Antrim, shortly after his arrival in the Territory,
opened up a restaurant in Santa Fe, the
Capitol, and one of his boarders was the jovial old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Ash Upson, my informant, who was then interested
in a newspaper at that place.</p>

<p>Often when Ash was too busily engaged about
his office to go to dinner, Mrs. Antrim would send
it by her little merry-eyed boy, Billy, who was the
pride of her life.</p>

<p>Finally Ash sold out and moved to Silver City,
which was then booming on account of its rich
mines. And it wasn't long until Mr. Antrim followed
and opened up another eating house there,
with Ash as a boarder again. Thus it will be seen
that my informant was just the same as one of the
family for quite a while.</p>

<p>The "Kid's" first man, as told to me by himself,
was a negro soldier in Ft. Union, whom he shot in
self-defence.</p>

<p>His next killing was a young blacksmith in Silver
City whom he killed in a personal encounter, but not
according to law, hence it was this scrape that first
caused him to become an outcast; driven from pillar
to post, out of reach of a kind mother's influence.</p>

<p>It was a cold stormy night when he, after kissing
his mother's pale cheeks for the last time on this
earth, rode out into the darkness, headed west<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
for the wilds of Arizona, where he soon became an
adept at cards and horse stealing.</p>

<p>He finally landed in the City of Chihuahua, Old
Mexico, with a pocket full of Arizona gold. Here
he led a gay life until one night when a bullet from
his trusty revolver sent a rich mexican monte-dealer
to his long and happy home.</p>

<p>The next we hear of him is in the friendly land
of Texas, where he remained in retirement until the
spring of 1876, when he drifted across the lonely
Gandalupe mountains into Lincoln County, New
Mexico, then the outlaw's Paradise.</p>

<p>At Lincoln, the county seat, he hired out as a
cow boy to a young Englishman by the name of
Tunstall.</p>

<p>In the spring of '78 Mr. Tunstall was killed by a
mob, headed by a fellow named Morton, from the
Reo Pecos.</p>

<p>The "Kid" hearing of his employer's foul murder,
rode into Lincoln from the Tunstall ranch to learn
the full particulars concerning the killing. He and
the young Englishman were warm friends and before
leaving the ranch he swore vengeance against every
one of the murderers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Arriving in the mexican Plaza of Lincoln the
"Kid" learned that Morton and crowd had pulled
back to the Reo Pecos. So he joined a crowd
composed of the following named parties: R. M.
Bruer, J. G. Skurlock, Charlie Bowder, Henry
Brown, Frank McNab, Fred Wayt, Sam Smith,
Jim French, McClosky and Johnny Middleton, and
started in pursuit. This was just the beginning of
the "bloody Lincoln County war" which you have
all read so much about. But it is said that the
"Kid" killed every man connected with the murder
of his friend before the war ended.</p>

<p>Billy was caught in a great many close places
during the six month's bloody encounter, but always
managed to escape, as though possessed of a charmed
life. There is one of his hair-breadth escapes
I wish to relate, just to show how cool he was in
time of danger.</p>

<p>He and about a dozen of his men were housed
up at lawyer McSween's in Lincoln, when thirty-five
of the Seven River "warriors" and two companies
of United States Soldiers under command of Col.
Dudly of the Ninth Cavalry, surrounded and set
the large two-story building on fire, determined to
capture or kill the young outlaw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>The house was burning on the south side from
whence the wind came, and as the fire advanced
the little crowd would move further north, into an
adjoining room. There was a fine piano in the parlor,
the property of Mrs. McSween, who was absent,
and on this the "Kid" played during the whole time,
"just to amuse the crowd outside" he said.</p>

<p>Finally everything was wrapped in flames but the
little kitchen which stood adjoining the main building
on the north, but still the coarse music continued
to sail forth out onto the night air.</p>

<p>At last the blaze began to stick its firey tongues
into the kitchen. Then the music ceased, and
the little band, headed by the "Kid" made a bold
dash for liberty, amidst the thick shower of hot
lead. The balance can be described best by quoting
a negro soldier's words, he being nearest the
kitchen door when the dash was made: "I jes' tell
you white folkses dis nigger was for getting away
from dah, kase dat Billy-goat was shooten wid a
gun and two six-pistols all bofe at de same time."</p>

<p>The "Kid" and Tom O'Phalliard were the only
ones who came out of this scrape unhurt. Mr.
McSween, owner of the burned building was among
the killed. He had nine bullets in his body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Late that fall when the war had ended, "Kid" and
the remainder of his little gang stole a bunch of
horses from the Seven River warriors, whom they
had just got through fighting with and drove them
across the Plains to the Texas Panhandle, at Tascosa
on the Canadian, where they were soon disposed
of at good figures.</p>

<p>After lying around the little town of Tascosa for
nearly a month, squandering their surplus wealth on
poor whisky and mexican woman, they, with the exception
of Fred Wayt and Henry Brown who struck
east for the Chickisaw nation where the former's
mother and two half-breed sisters lived, pulled back
to Lincoln County, New Mexico, to continue their
lawlessness.</p>

<p>From that time on, the "Kid" made a specialty of
stealing cattle and horses, although he would kill
a man now and then, for what he supposed to be a
just cause. Let it be said right here that the "Kid"
was not the cruel hearted wretch that he was pictured
out to be in the scores of yellow-back novels,
written about him. He was an outlaw and maybe
a very wicked youth, but then he had some good
qualities which, now that he is no more, he should
be credited with. It has been said and written that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
he would just as soon shoot an innocent child as a
mule-eared rabbit. Now this is all wrong, for he
was noted as being kind to the weak and helpless;
there is one case in particular which I can prove:</p>

<p>A man, now a highly respected citizen of White
Oaks, was lying at the point of death in Ft. Sumner,
without friends or money, and a stranger, when the
"Kid," who had just come into town from one of his
raids, went to his rescue, on hearing of his helpless
condition; the sick man had been placed in an old
out-house on a pile of sheep skins. The "Kid" hired
a team and hauled him to Las Vegas, a distance of
over a hundred miles, himself, where he could receive
care and medical aid. He also paid the doctor
and board bills for a month, besides putting a few
dollars in money in the sick man's hand as he bid
him good bye.</p>

<p>This circumstance was told to me by the sick man
himself, who at the time was hale and hearty, on
hearing of the "Kid's" death. While relating it the
tears chased one another down his manly cheeks,
to the end, at which time he pulled out a large red
handkerchief and wiped them away.</p>

<p>After the "Kid's" capture at Stinking Springs, he
was lodged in jail at Santa Fe, and the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
spring taken to Mesilla, county seat of Dona Ana
county, and tried before Judge Bristol for the murder
of Sheriff Brady, during the Lincoln county
war.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to be taken to Lincoln, and
hung on the 13th day of May. On the 21st day of
April he was turned over to Pat. Garrett, who, being
sheriff, was to see that the law was carried out.</p>

<p>There being no jail in Lincoln, Garrett used his
office, which was up-stairs in the two-story court
house, to guard the prisoner in. Robert Ollinger
and J. W. Bell, two men who should have been
hung before William Bonney was born&mdash;judging
from reliable reports, were secured to do the
guarding.</p>

<p>The morning of April, 28th, Garrett was making
preparations to go to White Oaks, when he told
the guards to be very watchful as the prisoner, not
having but a few more days to live, might make a
desperate effort to escape.</p>

<p>Ollinger who hated the "Kid," they having fought
against one another in the Lincoln County war,
spoke up and said: "Don't worry Pat, we'll watch
him like a goat." So saying he unlocked the armory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
a small closet in the wall, and getting out his
double-barrel shot gun, put eighteen buck-shot in
each barrel. Then setting it back, remarked, at
the same time glancing over in the opposite corner
at the "Kid" who was sitting on a stool, shackled and
hand-cuffed: "I bet the man that gets them will
feel it!" The "Kid" gave one of his hopeful smiles
and said: "You might be the one to get them
yourself."</p>

<p>After Garrett left, the two guards had five more
prisoners to look after. But they were allowed to
wear their pistols, for fear of being mobbed by a
crowd of Tulerosa mexicans who had chased them
into Lincoln. They had given themselves up to
Garrett more for protection than anything else.
They had killed four Tulerosa mexicans, in a hand
to hand fight, the day before, hence the mob being
after them. One of those prisoners was a young
Texan by the name of Chas. Wall, who had received
two almost fatal bullet wounds in the fracas of the
day before. It was from this young man, Mr. Wall,
whom I became personally acquainted with afterwards,
that I received my information from, in regard
to the "Kid's" escape, etc.</p>

<p>About five o'clock, that evening, Ollinger took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the armed prisoners across the street, to the hotel,
to supper, leaving Bell to guard the "Kid."</p>

<p>According to what the "Kid" told after his escape,
Bell became interested in a newspaper, and while
thus engaged, he slipped one of his hand-cuffs, which
he could have done long before if the right chance
had been presented, and made a leap towards his
guard, using the hand-cuff as a weapon.</p>

<p>Bell almost fainted on looking up from his paper.
He broke for the door after receiving a stunning
lick over the head with the hand-cuff. But the
"Kid" was right at his heels; and when he got to
the door and started down stairs the "Kid" reached
forward and jerked the frightened man's pistol which
still hung at his side, he having never made an effort
to pull it. Bell fell dead out in the back yard, near
the foot of the stairs, with a bullet hole through his
body.</p>

<p>"Kid" then hobbled, or jumped, his legs being
still shackled, to the armory and kicking the door
open secured Ollinger's shot-gun, which contained
the eighteen buck-shot in each barrel. Then springing
to an open window, in an adjoining room, under
which the other guard would have to come to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
up stairs, he waited patiently for his "meat," as he
termed it.</p>

<p>He hadn't waited long though when Ollinger,
who had started on hearing the shooting, came
trotting under the window. "Kid" called in a pleasant
voice: "Hello, Bob!" Robert looked up, but just
in time to receive eighteen buck-shot in his breast.
The "Kid" then walked out onto the balcony, fronting
on Main street, and emptied the other barrel into
the dead body of Ollinger. Then breaking the gun
in two over the balcony railing he threw the pieces
at the corpse, saying: "Take that you s&mdash;&mdash; of a
b&mdash;&mdash;h! You will never follow me with that gun
again!"</p>

<p>This proceeding was witnessed by nearly a hundred
citizens, nearly all of whom sympathized with
the "Kid," although they didn't approve of his law-breaking.
There was a few of his bitter enemies
in town, though, but they soon hunted their holes,
each one trying to pull the hole in after him, so as
to be hid from the outside world.</p>

<p>After being supplied from the armory with a good
winchester, two colts "45" pistols and four belts of
cartridges, he ordered a file thrown up to him, which
was done without ceremony; he also ordered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
deputy County Clerk's pony and saddle brought out
into the street, which was also done in double quick
time.</p>

<p>The shackles being filed in two he danced around
on the balcony quite a while, as though he was the
happiest mortal on earth.</p>

<p>As he went to mount, the firey pony, which was
being held out in the street, and which had once
belonged to him, broke loose and ran back to the
stable. But he was soon brought back, and this
time held until the "Kid" was securely seated in the
saddle.</p>

<p>After bidding everybody in sight adieu he rode
slowly towards the setting sun, the winchester still
gripped in his right hand. But when he arrived at
the end of Main street he pulled off his hat, and
waving it over his head, yelled at the top of his
voice: "Three cheers for Billy the Kid!" Then
putting spurs to the pony he dashed out of sight.</p>

<p>After traveling about four miles west he turned
north-east, across the Capitan mountains, towards
Ft. Sumner.</p>

<p>About the first of July, Garrett, who hadn't hunted
much for the "Kid" since his escape, received a letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
from a Mr. Brazil, who lived near Ft. Sumner, informing
him of the "Kid's" presence in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Garrett after answering the letter, asking Mr.
Brazil to meet him at a certain spot on a certain
night, secured the services of John W. Poe, one of
the whitest and bravest men in the Territory, and
taking his Deputy, "Kip" McKinnie along, struck
out for "Sumner" to capture the Kid if possible.</p>

<p>The little party of three arrived at the mouth of
Tayban Arroyo, on the Reo Pecos, where Garrett
had written Brazil to meet him, about dark on the
night of July 13th. They waited there all night
and Mr. Brazil failed to show up.</p>

<p>Mr. Poe being a stranger in that country, and not
known in the Post, Garrett sent him to the town, a
distance of five miles, to try and learn, by keeping
his ears open and mouth shut, of the "Kid's" whereabouts,
while he and "Kip" would meet him at
"Sunny-side" a ranch seven miles above "Sumner."</p>

<p>About sundown Poe met his two companions, at
Sunny-side, but was no wiser than when he had left
them. Garrett then concluded that they would all
ride into the town and if Peet Maxwell was at home
he could maybe get some information from him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Arriving in an old orchard back of the Maxwell
mansion about ten o'clock that night, they tied
their horses and crawled around to the front of the
building.</p>

<p>There was a long porch on the south side of the
house and about midway was Peet's room, the door
of which opened onto the porch. Garrett knew
where the room was, and there they headed for.</p>

<p>On arriving in the front yard opposite the door
of Peet's room, which was wide open, the night
being very hot, Garrett told his companions to lie
flat down in the grass while he slipped into the
room.</p>

<p>He found Peet asleep, but awakened him. He
then laid down by the side of Peet, and they began
talking.</p>

<p>Back of the Maxwell house was an adobe cabin
in which lived an old mexican Peon. The mexican
had gone to bed, and by a greasy looking table sat
the "Kid," who had just come in from the hills. He
had pulled off his boots to rest his tired feet, and
was glancing over a newspaper.</p>

<p>Throwing down the paper he told the Peon to get
up and cook him some supper, as he was very hungry.
Being told that there was no meat in the house he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
picked up a butcher-knife which was lying on the
table, and said: "I will go and get Peet to rustle me a
piece." He started without either hat or boots.</p>

<p>While walking along on the porch, butcher-knife
in hand, he discovered the two men out in the grass,
and, drawing his pistol, asked in mexican: Quien
es? Quien es? (Who's there? Who's there?)
Not getting an answer, the boys thinking he was
one of the Peons, he backed into the door of Peet's
room, and then turning towards the bed, which was
to the left of the door, he asked: "Peet, who is
that out there?" Not receiving an answer again,
and being suspicious of some one being in bed with
Peet, he began backing towards the opposite side
of the room, at the same time asking: "Who in
the h&mdash;l is in here? Who in the h&mdash;l is in here?"</p>

<p>Peet whispered to Garrett: "That's him Pat."
And by that time the "Kid" had backed until the
light shone full upon him, through one of the south
windows, giving Garrett a good chance to make a
center shot.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! went Garrett's pistol. The first
bullet took effect in the "Kid's" heart, while the next
one struck the ceiling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>The remains of what was once a fond mother's
darling were buried next day in the old dilapidated
Military Cemetery, without a murmer, except from
one, a pretty young half-breed mexican damsel,
whose tears, no doubt, has dampened the lonely
grave more than once.</p>

<p>Thus ended the life of William H. Bonney, one
of the coolest-headed, and most daring young outlaws
that ever lived. He had dwelt upon this
earth just 21 years, seven months and 21 days.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">WRESTLING WITH A DOSE OF SMALL
POX ON THE LLANO ESTICADO.</p>

<p>After leaving Toyah I followed the railroad east
cross the Reo Pecos, out onto the Llano Esticado
and through the sixty mile stretch of Sand
Hills.</p>

<p>At Sand Hill Station, about midway through the
sand hills, I left the railroad and branched off in a
north-easterly direction in search of buffalo-hunter's
camps. Knowing buffalo were getting scarce, and
having heard of a great many hunters being in the
vicinity of Ceader Lake, I thought it a good idea
to go out there and see what kind of game they
were killing. Being nearly south of the Canadian
River country, I thought maybe they were killing
cattle which had drifted down in there during the
winters. But I was mistaken. I found their camps
black with genuine buffalo hides. There being no
ranches in that wild scope of country the buffalo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
what few there were left, had nearly all congregated
in there.</p>

<p>I played a single-handed game of freeze-out the
first two nights after leaving the railroad, for there
came a terrible snow storm, which covered up the
buffalo-chips, there being no wood in that whole
country, so that I couldn't make a fire to warm by.</p>

<p>After striking the first buffalo-camp, then I was
all right, for I could get directions how to find the
next one, etc.</p>

<p>I finally, by circling around to the east, and then
south, struck the railroad again, and landed in the
town of Big Springs; where I was mistaken for a
horse-thief, whom I answered the description of,
and told to "skip" by one of my friends, a stranger
who recognized me as the turkey shooter from
Toyah. I didn't skip; and the thing was finally
straightened up to their entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>I was out of money by this time, but found a
draft in the express office awaiting me. Not having
any particular use for the draft I swapped it off
for a hundred dollars in money, to the express
manager.</p>

<p>After looking through a few herds around the
Springs I pulled north-east for the head of Colorado<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
River, to take a look over the Lum Slaughter range,
which extended from the head of Colorado River
down to Colorado City on the railroad, a distance
of about sixty miles. I went to all the sign camps,
and also the head-quarter ranch, but didn't let my
business, residence or name be known, which caused
the boys to believe I was "on the dodge."</p>

<p>I rode into the lively little town of Colorado City
one afternoon about four o'clock, and imagine my
surprise at meeting Miss Bulah Newell on her way
home from school. She and Mrs. Newell had left
Toyah shortly after I did. They had left Mr.
Newell at home to run the Hotel. And Mrs. Newell
had accompanied Bulah to Colorado City, the nearest
place where there was a school, so as to keep "the
wild rattled-brain girl," as she called her, under her
wing. They had rented a little cottage and were
keeping house.</p>

<p>I ran out of money shortly after striking Colorado
City, my expenses being high, having to pay three
dollars a day to keep my two horses at a feed stable,
and one dollar and a half per day for my own board,
lodging, etc., but found a good friend, Mr. Snyder,
a merchant, who let me have all I wanted on my
good looks until I could write to the ranch for some.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>While waiting for an answer to my letter I would
put in my spare time taking little spins out into
the country, looking through herds of cattle, etc.
The longest trip I made was three days, down on the
Concho River, and that was just two days and a half
longer than I cared to be away from Miss Bulah.</p>

<p>The mail finally brought two hundred dollars
worth of "L. X." drafts, wrapped up in a letter from
Mr. Erskine Clement, reminding me of the fact that
his company wasn't a First National Bank. This
of course was a hint for me to be more economical.</p>

<p>Having to be in Mesilla, New Mexico, a distance
of five hundred and fifty miles, by the last of March,
and wanting to look over some small cattle ranges
on the route, I struck out. I hated to leave Colorado
City on account of Bulah, but was anxious to
leave on account of the small-pox beginning to
spread there.</p>

<p>A forty-mile ride brought me to Big Springs,
where I lay two days with a burning fever. The
morning of the third day I pulled out, across the
Staked Plains for the Reo Pecos, still feeling sick.</p>

<p>That night I stopped at one of the section houses,
which were located every ten miles along the railroad.
And the next morning after riding about five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
miles I became so sick that I had to dismount and
lie down in the grass. After groaning and tumbling
around about two hours I fell asleep.</p>

<p>About sundown an east bound freight train came
along, which scared my ponies and awakened me.
I felt terribly; my lips were parched, my bones
ached and my tongue felt as though it was swollen
out of shape. I started to lie down again, after the
noise from the passing train had died out, but there
being an ugly looking black cloud in the north,
which indicated a norther, I concluded to brace up
and ride to the next section house, a distance of
about five miles.</p>

<p>Arriving there, just as a cold norther was springing
up, and riding up to the fence I called: "Hello!"
in a feeble voice. A gentleman came out, and on
informing him that I was sick, he told me to go in
the house, that he would unsaddle and take care of
my horses.</p>

<p>I walked into a large room where a nice blazing
fire greeted my eyes. There was a lady sitting by
the fire sewing. On looking up at me, as I stepped
into the door, she gave a scream, which brought her
husband in on the double quick. "Small-pox, small-pox,"
was all she could say. The gentleman looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
at me and asked: "Are you from Colorado City?"
"Yes," was my answer. "Well, you have got it, and
I am sorry we can't keep you here to-night. I hate
to turn a sick man out such a night as this, but I
have got a wife and three little children here whose
lives are at stake."</p>

<p>I had never thought of small-pox since leaving
Colorado City, until the good lady put me in mind
of it.</p>

<p>Oh, how my heart did ache at the thoughts of
that dreadful disease, and having to go out into the
cold night air. It was pitch dark and beginning to
sleet when I mounted and struck out, west, aiming
to go on to the next section house, ten miles, and
try my luck there.</p>

<p>About half an hour after the light over my shoulder
had disappeared I began to grow weaker, so
much so that I could hardly sit on my saddle.
So finally, dismounting, I unsaddled and staking the
two hungry ponies out to a telegraph pole, rolled
myself up in my blankets, my saddle for a pillow,
and went to sleep.</p>

<p>I awakened just as day was breaking. The
ground was covered with snow, and I was almost
frozen. I felt as though I had been sent for and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
couldn't go. My mouth, I could tell by feeling it,
was covered with sores, in fact it was one solid scab,
and so were my shoulders and back. Strange to
say there wasn't a sore on any other part of my
body. Those sores on my mouth was what attracted
the lady's attention the evening before, although
they had just began to show themselves then.</p>

<p>With great difficulty I saddled up and continued
on towards the section house. This time I made
up my mind not to let the folks know where I was
from, and if they had cheek enough to ask I intended
to say Ft. Concho. To avoid the sores on
my mouth being seen I tied a silk handkerchief
around it. And should they ask any questions about
that, I intended telling them I had some fever blisters
on my mouth, etc.</p>

<p>I found only one man, the cook, at the Section
house this time, the section hands having gone to
work. I was treated like a white head by the cook,
who no doubt took me for a desperado or horse-thief,
by my looks. He thought no doubt the
handkerchief was tied over my face to keep from
being recognized.</p>

<p>I informed him that I was feeling bad and would
like to lie down a few moments, etc. He led the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
way up stairs where the section hands slept and
told me to occupy any of the dirty looking beds
there. I laid down and told him to bring me up a
cup of coffee. He brought up a good breakfast
and after he left I undone the handkerchief and
tried to eat, but couldn't, on account of my tongue
being so badly swollen.</p>

<p>I found a looking glass in the room and took a
squint at myself, and must say that I was indeed a
frightful looking aspect, my face from nose to chin
being a solid scab and terribly swollen. No wonder
I frightened the lady so badly, I thought.</p>

<p>After drinking the hot cup of coffee I went down
stairs, gave the cook a silver dollar for his kindness
and pulled out. I was very anxious to get to a
doctor, and Toyah was the nearest place to find one
unless I turned back to Colorado City, which I
hated to do on account of having to attend court in
Mesilla, soon.</p>

<p>I arrived in Toyah about noon of the sixth day
out from Big Springs. I headed straight for the
Alverado House and who do you suppose was
standing in the door when I rode up? Miss Bulah.
The small pox had scared her and her mother away
from Colorado City. The first thing she said was:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
"Hello, what's the matter with your face?" "Nothing
but fever blisters." was my answer.</p>

<p>I didn't dismount, for fear of giving the pretty
little miss the small pox, but rode a few blocks to
Doctor Roberson's office, telling her that I was going
after some fever medicine and would be back in
a few minutes, etc.</p>

<p>The Doctor informed me that the danger was all
over with, and that, if I hadn't been made of good
stuff, I would have surely died, being exposed to
bad weather, etc. He gave me some salve to dry
up the sores, that being all there was to do at that
stage of the disease, he said, and advised me to
leave town, for said he: "If the citizens discover
that you have had the small pox, they will have you
taken to the pest house, where there are already
three occupants, although the danger of it being
catching from you is past." I assured him that I
would fix it so they wouldn't find it out.</p>

<p>On arriving back to the Alverado House, my face
still tied up, I hired a boy to take care of my ponies
and then telling Miss Bulah that I wanted a room
to myself, I went to bed.</p>

<p>Bulah would bring my meals into the room and
sometimes sit down to wait until I got through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
eating, but I would never commence until she left.
I would generally let her stay until she got ready
to go, telling her that I wasn't hungry just then, but
would try and eat it after awhile, etc. She would
finally get tired and go, then I would lock the
door and undo the handkerchief from my face. I
kept this up a week, before eating my meals at the
table with the rest of the boarders.</p>

<p>I finally struck out for El Paso, two hundred
miles over a dry, waterless plain, and another hundred
up the Rio Grande valley, making three
hundred miles in all.</p>

<p>I hove in sight of the Rio Grande River one
morning, but never got there until sundown.</p>

<p>When I arrived within a few miles of the river
I noticed a covered wagon and what I supposed to
be a camp, down the valley, about three miles out
of my way. I finally concluded to turn off and go
and stop with whoever they were for the night.</p>

<p>I found it to be a mexican camp, an old man,
two boys and a grown girl. They had come from
Larado and were on their way to El Paso. They
gave me a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>Next morning about daylight I got up and went
out to change Croppy, he having been staked and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Buckshot hobbled the evening before, in a fresh
place, but lo, and behold! there was nothing there
but the stake.</p>

<p>I circled around and found both of the ponies
tracks leading towards the river, a few hundred
yards west, I followed, and found they had crossed
over. After standing on the bank a few seconds,
dreading to get wet, I went over too. The water
was only about waist deep.</p>

<p>Near the water's edge on the other side I found
some mocassin tracks in the soft sand. I could see
through the whole thing then, from indications, etc:
two footmen, who wore mocassins, had stolen my
horses and pulled into Old Mexico for safety. Where
the tracks were visible in the sand, there was no
doubt, they had dismounted and taken a farewell
drink, or maybe filled a canteen, before leaving
the river.</p>

<p>After following the trail, there being just the
tracks of two horses, a few hundred yards out from
the river I turned and went back to camp, to try
and hire the old mexican's horse to follow them on.</p>

<p>The old fellow only had one pony, his team being
oxen and I had to talk like a Dutch uncle to get it,
as he argued that I was liable to get killed and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
lose the pony by the operation. I finally though
put up the price of the horse as security and promised
the old fellow ten dollars a day for the use of
him, when I returned. This seemed to give satisfaction,
even with the two boys who would have to
hoof it after the oxen every morning, in case the
pony never returned.</p>

<p>Just about sundown as I turned a sharp curve,
near the top of the long chain of high mountains
which run parallel with the river, I came in sight of
both of my ponies staked to a pinyon tree, grazing.</p>

<p>I immediately rode out of sight, dismounted, tied
my tired pony to a tree and crawled to the top of a
knoll, where I could see the surrounding country
for half a mile around. But I couldn't see a living
thing except the two horses, and the one I had just
left.</p>

<p>Finally, bang! went a shot, which sounded to be
at least half a mile away, on the opposite side of
the mountains.</p>

<p>Thinks I now there's either a ranch over there
and the two thieves have walked to it, to keep from
being seen with the horses, or else they have gone
out hunting to kill something for supper. At any
rate I took advantage of their absence and stole my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ponies back. Near where they were tied was a
small spring of cool water; the first water I had
seen since leaving the river.</p>

<p>After taking a hasty drink myself, and letting the
pony I was on, fill up, the other two not being dry,
I took a straight shoot down grade, for the "eastern
shores of the Rio Grande," a distance of about
thirty-five miles. It was then nearly dark.</p>

<p>I arrived in camp next morning just as the big
yellow sun was peeping over the top of the Sierra
Blanco mountains; and the old mexican, who was
awaiting my return, was glad to see me back.</p>

<p>That night I stopped with an old fat fellow by the
name of Chas. Willson, in the little town of Camp
Rice, and the next night I put up in the beautiful
town of San Elizario, which is situated in the centre
of the garden spot of the whole Rio Grande valley.</p>

<p>The next morning I crossed the river into Old
Mexico and took a three day's hunt through the
mountains in search of a herd which had come from
the north, and had crossed the river at San Elizario
about a week before. I found it, but was unacquainted
with any of the brands that the cattle wore.
The herd had been stolen though, I think, from the
way the men acted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>I finally landed in El Paso and found a letter in
the Post Office from John Poe, written at Lincoln,
New Mexico, advising me not to go to Mesilla until
the day that Court set, as Cohglin, who was out on
bond, was there and might have my light blown
out, I being one of the main witnesses against him.
Also, it had been reported that he had said he would
give five thousand dollars to get me out of the way.
He furthermore advised me in the letter to take
the train from El Paso, as the old fellow might have
some mexicans watching along the road for me.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XXIX" id="Chapter_XXIX"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XXIX.</span></h2>

<p class="center extraspacebot">IN LOVE WITH A MEXICAN GIRL.</p>

<p>I found El Paso, to be a red-hot town of about
three thousand inhabitants. There were also
about that number of people in Paso Del Norte,
across the river in Old Mexico. I spent several
days in each place.</p>

<p>I finally, after leaving my ponies in good hands,
boarded one of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe trains for Las Cruces, two and a half miles from
Mesilla, the county seat.</p>

<p>There being better accommodations, in the way
of Hotels, in "Cruces," nearly every one who was
attending court would stop there and ride to the
county seat in one of the "hacks" which made
hourly trips between the two places. Consequently
I put up at the Montezuma House, in Las Cruces.</p>

<p>There were several Lincoln County boys there
when I arrived. Poe and Garrett came down next
day. Mr. and Mrs. Nesbeth also came as witnesses
against Cohglin. Mrs. Nesbeth had heard Mr.
Cohglin make the contract with, "Billy the Kid," to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
buy all the stolen cattle he would bring to his ranch.
But the good lady didn't live long afterwards, for
she, her husband, a stranger, who was going from
"Cruces" to Tulerosa with them, and a little girl
whom they had adopted were all murdered by unknown
parties. Cohglin was accused of having the
crime committed, but after fighting the case through
the courts, he finally came clear.</p>

<p>A few days after my arrival in Las Cruces I went
back to El Paso after my ponies. I ate dinner
there and rode into Las Cruces about sundown. A
pretty quick fifty-five mile ride, considering part of
it being over a rough mountain road. The cause of
my hurry was, we couldn't tell what minute the
Cohglin case would be called up for trial.</p>

<p>I had a little love scrape while loafing in Las
Cruces. I don't mention it because my love scrapes
were so scarce, but because it was with a Mexican
girl, and under curious circumstances, that is, the
circumstances were curious from the fact that we
became personally acquainted and never spoke to
one another, except by signs, and through letters.</p>

<p>Her name was Magdalena Ochoa, niece to the
rich Bankers Ochoa's in El Paso, Tucson, Arizona,
and Chihuahua, Old Mexico, and she was sweet sixteen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
She lived with her grandmother, whose
residence was right straight across the street from
the Montezuma Hotel, and who wouldn't let a young
man, unless he was a Peon, come inside of her
house. And she wouldn't let Magdalena go out of
her sight, for fear she would let some of the young
"Gringoes" make love to her.</p>

<p>I first saw her one Sunday morning when she
and her grandmother were going to church. I
was standing out in front of the Hotel hugging an
awning post, and wishing that I had something
more human-like to hug, when they passed within
a few feet of me. The girl looked up, our eyes
met, and such a pair of eyes I had never seen.
They sparkled like diamonds, and were imbedded
in as pretty a face as was ever moulded. Her form
was perfection itself; she had only one drawback
that I didn't like and that was her grandmother. I
immediately unwound my arms from around the
post and started to church too.</p>

<p>The church house was a very large building, and
the altar was in one end. The couple I was following
walked up near the altar and took a seat on the
right hand side&mdash;on the dirt floor, there being no
such thing as seats in the building&mdash;which was reserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
for ladies, while the left hand side, of the
narrow passage way, was for the men. I squatted
myself down opposite the two, and every now and
then the pretty little miss would cast sparks from
her coal black eyes over towards me which would
chill my very soul with delight.</p>

<p>When church was over I followed, to find out
where she lived. I was exceedingly happy when I
found she was a near neighbor to me, being only a
few steps across the street.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of that day setting out under the
awning in front of the Hotel, straining my eyes in
hopes of getting a glimpse of her beautiful form
through the large bay window which opened out
from the nicely furnished parlor onto the street.
But not a glimpse did I get. I retired that night
with the vision of a lovely sunburnt angel floating
before my eyes.</p>

<p>The next morning I went to Mesilla and answered
to my name when it was called, by the Judge, and
then told Poe that I had some very important business
to attend to in "Cruces" and for him, in case
the Cohglin case was called, to hire a man at my
expense and send him after me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>On arriving back to the Hotel I took a seat in an
old arm-chair under the awning. I was all alone,
nearly every one being in Mesilla.</p>

<p>Finally Magdalena brought her sewing and sat
down among the flowers in the bay window. It was
indeed a lovely picture, and would have been a case
of "love among the roses" if it hadn't been for her
old grandparent, who every now and then appeared
in the parlor.</p>

<p>At last I, having a good chance, no one being in
sight but her and I, threw a kiss, to see how I stood
in her estimation. She immediately darted out of
sight, but soon re-appeared and peeping around a
cluster of roses, returned the compliment. She
then left the room and I never seen her again till
after dinner.</p>

<p>I then started into the Hotel, but was detained by
a voice calling, through the closed blinds of a window
near by: "Me ketch you! Me ketch you!"
Come to find out it was the proprietor's wife, Mrs.
Duper, an old mexican lady, who had been watching
our maneuvers. She then opened the blinds
and asked me in broken English, what I was trying
to do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, much, just trying to catch on, is
all;" was my answer.</p>

<p>The old lady then broke out in one of her jovial
fits and said: "You ketch on? Me bet you ten
tousand dollars you no ketch him!" She then went
on and told me how closely the old lady "Grandma
Ochoa" watched her young niece. In fact, she gave
me the girl's history from the time of her birth: Her
father and mother were both dead and she, being
the only child, was worth over a million dollars, all
in her own name. This of course was good news
to me, as it gave my love a solid foundation, and
spread a kind of gold-like lining over the young
lady's beauty.</p>

<p>Finally, after court had been in session two weeks
the Cohglin case was called up. His lawyers were
Col. Rynerson and Thornton, while the Territory
was represented by Newcomb, District Attorney,
and A. J. Fountain whose services Poe had secured.</p>

<p>Mr. Cohglin began to grow restless, for the "Pen"
stared him in the face. There were eight indictments
against him, but the worst one was where he
had butchered the cattle after being notified by me
not to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>His only hopes now was to "sugar" the prosecuting
Attorney, and that no doubt was easily done,
or at least it would have looked easy to a man up a
tree. You see Cohglin was worth at least a hundred
thousand dollars, and therefore could well
afford to do a little sugaring, especially to keep out
of the Penitentiary. At any rate whether the Attorney
was bought off or not, the trial was put off,
on account of illness on said Attorney's part, until
the last days of court.</p>

<p>When the case came up again Mr. Prosecuting
Attorney was confined to his room on account of
a severe attack of cramp-colic. Judge Bristol was
mad, and so was Poe. They could see through the
whole thing now.</p>

<p>That night Cohglin made a proposition that he
would plead guilty to buying stolen cattle knowing
they were stolen, if the one case in which he had
killed cattle after being notified not to, would be
dismissed, or thrown entirely out of court.</p>

<p>It was finally decided to do that, as then he could
be sued for damages, so the next day he plead
guilty to the above charge, and was fined one hundred
and fifty dollars besides costs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Fountain, our lawyer then entered suit against
him for ten thousand dollars damage.</p>

<p>I was then relieved. My mileage and witness
fees amounted to something over a hundred dollars,
this time. Of course that was appreciated as it was
my own, over and above my wages. It came handy
too as I was almost broke and needed it to take me
home. I had spent all of my own money, besides
nearly one hundred and fifty dollars borrowed from
Poe.</p>

<p>It was the first day of May, I think, when I
mounted Croppy in front of the Hotel, threw a farewell
kiss at Miss Magdalena, who was standing in
the bay-window, and started east, in company with
Chas. Wall&mdash;the young man I mentioned as being
a prisoner in Lincoln at the time of "Kid's" escape.
I hated to part with the pleasant smiles of my little
mexican sweetheart, but then it had to be done. I
still hold a rose and a bundle of beautifully written
letters to remember her by.</p>

<p>We stopped at San Augustine the first night out
from "Cruces," and from there we struck south-east
across the white sands for the mouth of Dog canyon&mdash;the
noted rendezvous of old Victoria and his
band of blood-thirsty Apache's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>I had heard so much about this beautiful Dog
canyon that I concluded to see it before going home,
so that if it proved to be as represented I could
secure it for a cattle ranch.</p>

<p>It was a ticklish job going there by ourselves, as
a telegram was received in Las Cruces, the morning
we left, that a band of Apache's had crossed
the Rio Grande at Colorow, killing three men there,
and were headed toward Dog canyon. But I had
faith in Croppy and Buckshot, they being well rested
and hog fat, carrying us out of danger should we
come in contact with them.</p>

<p>We arrived at the noted canyon after being away
from water nearly two days. It was a lovely place,
at the foot of Gandalupe mountains.</p>

<p>After leaving there we went through the following
towns: La Luz, Tulerosa, South Fork and Ft.
Stanton.</p>

<p>At the last named place Charlie Wall left me, and
I continued on alone.</p>

<p>I remained in White Oaks a few days, looking
over my town property, I having bought some lots
and built cabins thereon, and examining the 'Old
Panhandle Tiger' gold mine, the one Stone, Chambers
and I owned. I had some of the rock assayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and it run twelve dollars in gold to the ton, besides
a few ounces in silver and about two million dollars
worth of hopes.</p>

<p>From White Oaks I went through Anton Chico,
San Lorenzo, Liberty and Tascosa, and arrived at
the "L. X." ranch after an absence of nearly eight
months, and about a three thousand mile ride.</p>

<p class="center extraspacebot">A SUDDEN LEAP FROM COW BOY TO MERCHANT.</p>

<p>About the first of July, shortly after my return,
Hollicott sent me to Kansas with a herd of
eight hundred fat steers. My outfit consisted of a
cook, chuck wagon, five riders, and six horses to
the rider.</p>

<p>We arrived in Caldwell, Kansas, near the northern
line of the Indian Territory, about September
the first.</p>

<p>After putting the cattle aboard of the cars, and
giving them a send-off towards Chicago, we all
proceeded to take in the "Queen City of the Border,"
as Caldwell is called. I immediately fell in love
with the town, also with a couple of young ladies,
and therefore concluded to locate. I bought some
lots and contracted a house built, with a view of
going after mother.</p>

<p>I then struck out with my outfit to attend the fall
round-ups in the vicinity of Camp Supply, Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Territory. Returning to Caldwell the latter part of
November, I boarded a train for Southern Texas,
after mother, by way of Saint Louis to visit my
sister whom I hadn't seen for thirteen long years.</p>

<p>I arrived in Saint Louis one evening&mdash;just in time
to let an old flop-eared Jew take me in to the extent
of a hundred dollars for a lot of snide jewelry and
a Jim-Crow suit of clothes.</p>

<p>Not caring to hunt sister until morning I went to
the Planter's House to put up for the night, and to
note the change of twelve years.</p>

<p>After taking a bath and getting into my new rigging,
I took a straight shoot for the office to make
inquiries about the old boys. I found a long-legged
youth behind the counter who, on asking how many
of the old hands of twelve years ago were still
there, pointed out Jimmy Byron, the kid I had the
fight with, behind the cigar and news stand, across
the hall. He was very busy at the time dishing out
cigars, etc. to the scores of old fat roosters and lean
dudes who were hurrying out after having eaten
their supper.</p>

<p>The rush was finally over and then I made myself
known. He was terribly glad, as well as surprised
to see me. We had parted as enemies but now met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
as friends. He informed me that there wasn't but
three, besides himself, of the old outfit left, and
those were the old steward, who was now proprietor,
"Old" Mike, who was still acting as night watchman,
and Cunningham, the fellow who had slapped me
and who was still clerk. The latter gentleman I
didn't get to shake hands with as he failed to put
in an appearance during my stay.</p>

<p>The next morning I struck out to hunt sister. I
was armed with an old letter which gave the address,
therefore had no trouble in finding her.</p>

<p>She was alone with her three pretty little girls,
her husband having gone up town to his place of
business&mdash;a drug store&mdash;when I found her.</p>

<p>The first thing she asked after kissing me, was,
where I got my new suit?</p>

<p>Of course I had to acknowledge that I bought
them from a Jew on Fourth street.</p>

<p>She then became frantic and wanted to know
why in the world I didn't go to Humphry's and get
them?</p>

<p>"Who in the dickens is Humphry?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought everybody knew Mr. Humphry,"
she continued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>She took me up town to this great establishment
of Humphry's that evening and there I learnt how
badly I had been bitten by the Jew.</p>

<p>I remained in the city about a week and my
brother-in-law spent most of his time showing me
the sights.</p>

<p>Before taking the train for Texas I bought mother
a trunk full of clothes, knowing that she would be
in need of them after having "roughed it" for
nearly eight years.</p>

<p>I stopped in Houston one day looking for Aunt
Mary, but learnt finally that she had moved to
the country.</p>

<p>I then took in Galveston and spent two days visiting
Uncle Nick and Aunt Julia. From there I went
to Indianola on a Morgan Steamship and became
sea sick; Oh, Lord! I concluded I would prefer the
hurricane deck of a Spanish pony to that of a ship,
every time.</p>

<p>In the town of Indianola I met a lot of my old
Peninsula playmates, who were there from Matagorda,
in their sail boats, with freight.</p>

<p>There being no boats down from Tresspalacious,
I left my trunk to be shipped up the first chance and
went to Matagorda with the two Williams' boys,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Johnny and Jimmy. Nearly all the Peninsula folks
lived in the vicinity of Matagorda now since the
great storm of 1875, washed everything they had
out into the Gulf, besides drowning about half of
their number. Hence me going to Matagorda to
visit them.</p>

<p>There were three Tresspalacious boys in Matagorda,
and one of them, Jim Keller, loaned me
his horse and saddle to ride home on.</p>

<p>Mother was happy when I told her to get ready
and go to Kansas with me. There was only one
thing she hated to leave behind, and that was her
wood pile. She had spent the past two years lugging
wood from along the creek and piling it up
against her old shanty for "old age," she said. I
suppose her idea in piling it against the house, on
all sides, was to keep it from blowing over, should
some kind of an animal accidently blow its breath
against it.</p>

<p>After spending about a week, visiting friends and
waiting for my trunk to arrive from Indianola, I
struck out with mother for the enterprising State of
Kansas.</p>

<p>I hired a neighbor, Mr. Cornelious, to take us to
the Railroad, fifty miles north. He hauled us in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
an old go cart&mdash;one that had been sent from Germany
in 1712&mdash;drawn by two brindle oxen.</p>

<p>We arrived in Caldwell a few days before Christmas
and after getting mother established in her
new house, I went to work for the "L. X." company
again.</p>

<p>I had secured a winter's job from Mr. Beals before
leaving therefore it was all ready for me to take
charge of on my return. The job was feeding and
taking care of about two hundred head of horses,
at the company's ranch on the Territory line, near
Caldwell.</p>

<p>Having lots of fat ponies to ride, I used to take
a dash up town nearly every night to see how
mother was getting along and to see my sweethearts.
Thus the winter passed off pleasantly.</p>

<p>About the first of March I received orders from
Mr. Beals, who was then at his home in Boston,
Mass. to get everything in shape to start for the
Panhandle at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>That very night, after those orders were received,
I fell head over heels in love with a pretty little
fifteen-year old, black-eyed miss, whom I accidently
met. It was a genuine case of love at first sight.
I wanted her, and wanted her badly, therefore I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
went to work with a brave heart and my face lined
with brass. It required lots of brass too, as I had
to do considerable figuring with the old gent, she
being his only daughter.</p>

<p>Just three days after meeting we were engaged
and at the end of the next three days we were
made one. And three days later I was on my way
to the Panhandle with an outfit of twenty-five men,
one hundred horses and six wagons.</p>

<p>An eighteen day's drive, southwest, brought us
to the "L. X." ranch. After laying there about a
week, resting up, Hollicott sent me and my outfit
south to attend the round ups in the Red River
country.</p>

<p>We arrived back at the ranch about July the first,
with three thousand head of "L. X." cattle which
had drifted south during the past winter.</p>

<p>As I was anxious to get back to Kansas to see
my wife and mother, Hollicott immediately gathered
eight hundred fat shipping steers and started me.</p>

<p>I arrived in Caldwell September the first, and
after shipping the herd, Mr. Beals ordered me to
take the outfit back to the Panhandle and get another
drove. This of course didn't suit, as I had
only been at home a few days. But then what could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
I do? I hated to give up a good job, with no prospects
of making a living by remaining in town.</p>

<p>I finally concluded to obey orders, so started
the men and horses up the Territory line, while I
and Sprague went to town with the wagon to
load it with chuck. Mr. Beals had taken the train
the day before to be absent quite a while. After
getting the wagon loaded and ready to start, I
suddenly swore off cow-punching and turned everything
over to Mr. Sprague, who bossed the outfit
back to the Panhandle.</p>

<p>The next day I rented a vacant room on Main
street and, rolling up my sleeves and putting on a
pair of suspenders, the first I had ever worn, started
out as a merchant&mdash;on a six-bit scale. Thus one
cow-puncher takes a sensible tumble and drops out
of the ranks.</p>

<p>Now, dear reader in bidding you adieu, will say:
should you not be pleased with the substance of this
<i>book</i>, I've got nothing to say in defence, as I gave
you the best I had in my little shop, but before you
criticise it from a literary standpoint, bear in mind
that the writer had fits until he was ten years of
age, and hasn't fully recovered from the effects.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
